0,0983797706,5,This is an inspirational and insightful book that is well written and contains some profound methods to improve your thinking and improve your life. The ideas and methods that Robbins suggests are not just theory but I can attest from personal experience that they really work as I have successfully used some of the concepts. Fried summarizes the best personal development strategies and combines it with brilliant business principles to help you become the entrepreneur of your own existence. I LOVED it.

I giggle as much as they do and I don't really mind reading it over and over :)  I would definitely give these as gifts too!"
2,1445604752,4,"Back in 1964, I was introduced to 'Johnnie' Johnson, the legendary RAF fighter ace, through reading his evocative WING LEADER autobiography. What a marvelous piece of writing that was; who would have thought a fighter ace could spin such memorable prose?!? Johnson's life and combat career are wonderfully chronicled in Dilip Sarkar's SPITFIRE ACE OF ACES, a 2011 Amberley Publishing release.<br /><br />With 38 1/2 kills, Johnson is the RAF's official top ace. All his kills were enemy fighters; all were scored while flying Spits. Yet, even more importantly, Johnson was one of the best fighter leaders the RAF produced during the war. These accomplishments resulted from Johnson being an avid hunter pre-war and an aggressive, enthusiastic sportsman who possessed the ability to motivate and lead men into combat. Initially flying with one of the most charismatic wing leaders - Douglas Bader - Johnson surpassed Bader, not only in terms of kills, but also in truly effective leadership that made every man in Johnson's unit feel important and part of a team.<br /><br />Sarkar does a fine job of relating Johnson's wartime career and the greatness inherent in the man. He interweaves material from interviews done with JEJ and his fellow RAF compatriots, Johnson's WING LEADER book, wartime news articles and official documents to create a multi-dimensional portrait. The text is illustarted with over 100 photographs, many of them rare.<br /><br />SPITFIRE ACE OF ACES is, very likely, THE definitive account of the life and times of this RAF legend. It deserves five stars. I had to give it four - actually 4 1/2 - because Sarkar didn't include an index.<br /><br />In any case, SPITFIRE ACE OF ACES is a wonderfully-researched, nicely-illustrated and appealing book that will appeal to all air combat enthusiasts. Highly recommended."
3,0393057941,5,"I disagree with those reviews that say this is not a book for beginners.  Perhaps if you just want to make a loaf of bread some weekend, then this book isn't for you.  But for \\""serious\\"" beginners who want to have success in short order,  this book is great!  The recipies, if followed closely, will lead to successful loaves and progressivly increased bread making skills.  I have had great success with sourdoughs and now bake with sourdough almost exclusively.<br /><br />I hope that the Cake Bible is as good."
4,1608322858,3,"Reading this book, I hoped to find more about success in life in general... but mostly what I found was about finding fulfillment in the daily grind. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing at all against making the most of fulfilling our responsibilities. We all need to do it. And really enjoying one's job, etc., is certainly a skill vital to having a great life. But when it comes to living -- just living -- there's more to life than \\""spicing up meetings.\\""<br /><br />And that's where this book left me feeling a bit left down. I think what it comes down to is this: Culberson makes a lot of assumptions that I and many others simply don't agree with. What he takes as the basic framework of life -- meetings, taxes, even having a job at all -- many others have managed successfully to do without. Take, for example, the inspiring story of the man who walked across America, [[ASIN:096387845X I Walked to the Moon and Almost Everybody Waved: The Curiously Inspiring Adventures of a Free Spirit Who Changed Lives]] by Ed Carlson.<br /><br />So if you are simply looking for a nice read on how to make the most of the rat race, I recommend Do It Well Make It Fun. But if you are looking for something more substantial that really digs in and questions common assumptions, I recommend looking somewhere else."
5,B001FVQAPW,5,"Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976) was a German theologian and professor of New Testament at the University of Marburg. He was the author of many influential books, such as [[ASIN:1565630416 The History of the Synoptic Tradition]], [[ASIN:0684143909 Jesus and the Word]], etc. Karl Jaspers (1883-1969) was a German psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher, who wrote many important books such as [[ASIN:B000S6THQE Reasons and Existenz]][[ASIN:0812210107 Philosophy of Existence]], [[ASIN:0300097352 Way to Wisdom: An Introduction to Philosophy]], [[ASIN:B0007EW69C Man in the modern age]], [[ASIN:0226394859 Future of Mankind]], etc.<br /><br />The translator notes, \\""The essay 'Myth and Religion' by Dr. Jaspers ... was later published (in 1953)... Bultmann's reply first appeared (in 1954)... Dr. Jaspers' rejoinder was first published in an open letter...\\""<br /><br />Jaspers argues, \\""It we forget that myth is also a code language, a cipher, it loses all reference to transcendence, it becomes mere tangible presence.\\"" (Pg. 14) He suggests that Bultmann \\""alternates between empirical, philological exegesis and a theological appropriation of religion. The two opposing goals, which are the historical investigation of religion and the primary comprehension of faith, do not add up to a convincing statement, but rather collapse for lack of tension and clarity.\\"" (Pg. 28)<br /><br />Bultmann replied, \\""(Jaspers) is as convinced as I am that a corpse cannot come back to life or rise from the grave, that there are no demons and no magic causality. But how am I, in my capacity as pastor, to explain, in my sermons and classes, texts dealing with the Resurrection of Jesus in the flesh, with demons, or with magic causality? And how am I, in my capacity as theological scholar, to guide the pastor in his task by my interpretation?... When (Jaspers) says that the redemptive history... must 'be tested existentially and judged on the basis of ... the truth that arises from it in the reality of life,' I can only reply to such a vague statement by the question, 'Well, how is this done?'\\"" (Pg. 60-61)<br /><br />Jaspers then asserts in his own reply, \\""you do not go far enough... I assay the differences between us in terms of the opposition between liberalism and orthodoxy, and I conclude that your position can be defined as orthodox. The actual meaning of my lecture, however, was to asert the rights of philosophy.\\"" (Pg. 72) He concludes, \\""The greatness of Protestantism... achieves reality only in exceptional individuals... who translate into action the great moral earnestness... inherent in this faith... I see hope in the liberal faith... which as such is capable of transforming the Biblical faith in all its manifestations.\\"" (Pg. 114-115)<br /><br />Although one suspects that the two protagonists are often missing the other's point, this still a fascinating interplay between these two thinkers.a vague statement by the question, 'Well, how is this done?'\\"" (Pg. 60-61)    Jaspers then asserts in his own reply, \\""you do not go far enough...

The scenes unfold page after page, and you never know what the characters might encounter next! If you have a little one I ABSOLUTELY reccommend you own a Richard Scarry picture book. They are timeless, fun and creative.

7,0670022969,5,"Colin Woodard has written the story of North America that should be taught in school in place of the simplified, sanitized, nearly fictional versions created, like all national histories, for the purpose of welding disparate peoples into a single nation by convincing them they all share a common history.  I just got it back from loaning to a friend and re-read it.  Like other reviewers here I had read Joel Garreau's \\""Nine Nations\\"" in the 1980s and more recently Kevin Phillips' \\""The Cousins Wars\\"" and Dante Chinni's \\""Patchwork Nation\\"".  They were full of interesting information, but Nine Nations and Patchwork Nation didn't address the origins or persistence of the notable regional differences among North Americans.  I think Woodard's main thesis is that these regional cultures left their marks so deeply that we are no longer consciously aware of them, and should be.  My experience living and working in several of these \\""nations\\"" indicates that the regional differences do persist, though national media and advertising have masked them.<br /><br />Reading \\""American Nations\\"" I felt the pieces falling into place.  I am undecided on the question of just how valid the thesis of eleven rival nations is as political science, but it makes for a fine explication of our history.  And as cultural anthropology it provides the same level of explanatory power for understanding our cultural differences that the theory of evolution provided for understanding biology, or that the theory of plate tectonics did for understanding planetary-scale geologic processes.  Just as those two sciences could not advance beyond the observational phase without a theoretical framework, this third dimension of historical immigration patterns transforms a two-dimensional hodgepodge of cultural observations into a meaningful three-dimensional portrait far more illuminating than the usual North-South analysis.<br /><br />The map on the \\""American Nations\\"" cover showed me that I grew up roughly where the Deep South, Appalachia, and El Norte meet in eastern Texas.  We said we were \\""Scotch-Irish\\"" but seemed to have no knowledge of or interest in how we came to be there, nor did I ever know anyone who was aware that there were early Spanish missions in the pine woods of East Texas or that there had been a large Cherokee village not four miles from my home.  Later I learned that my own family had entered the U.S. in South Carolina from Barbados in the 1680s; little is known about them except that they were poor whites, so now we know there is a good chance they were indentured servants to Barbadian slave lords.  How many Americans know the Deep South was founded at Charleston by migrants from Barbados?  I never did. I had always lumped Tidewater, Appalachia, and the Deep South as \\""the South\\"", but distinguishing them by origin explains a lot.<br /><br />Now I have some insight into features of my county that have puzzled me for decades: why the tiny community where I attended school in the 1950s and 60s was clustered around its original plantation house, Cumberland Presbyterian church, and cotton fields (it was founded by a slave-holding family from Savannah, Georgia in the 1840s or 50s); why my neighbors had such casual contempt for blacks, Jews, Mexicans, Indians, Catholics, Chinese, and all other foreigners; why Ku Klux Klan actions were still fresh in older folks' memories; why blacks lived either in their own parts of town literally across the tracks or entirely separately in their own towns or isolated communities tucked away in the woods; why my parents were so puzzled that \\""our Negroes\\"" seemed dissatisfied with our hand-me-down clothes and an occasional pig (I recall puzzled discussions of \\""What do they want?\\"" implying lack of gratitude); why some neighbors said \\""Bide a wee\\"" for \\""stay a while\\"" or occasionally exclaimed \\""Gott in himmel!\\"" but otherwise spoke in Texas drawl; why hillfolk in remote cabins in the woods practiced subsistence hunting using antique Springfield and Henry rifles, had a near-religious devotion to one-shot kills and complete disregard for hunting season and licenses, and distilled their own liquor (Appalachians for sure!); why there was a deeply ingrained presumption that gentlemen rode horses and peasants walked, so any poor farmer that came into oil money bought horses immediately (Deep South cavaliers influence); why there was hardly any familiarity with or emphasis on attending college, and disdain for the (rare) \\""know it all college boy\\"" (Appalachian ignorance and apathy influenced by Deep South resistance to education for the masses); why employers referred to employees as \\""hands\\""; why our relatives in far southwest Texas seemed to us to live in a different country (they did - El Norte), while relatives in Tennessee and business associates in Mississippi seemed to come from an earlier and more violent time; why Cajuns in south Louisiana and southeast Texas seemed like such an anomaly in the Deep South in their Catholicism and complete disregard of racial boundaries (New France egalitarianism); maybe even why some blacks in East Texas practiced a strange mixture of Southern Baptist services and voodoo lore - one local black church was even named the Voodoo Baptist Church, and the pastor roamed the area on foot wearing an animal skin cape and carrying a long shepherd's staff (West Africa via the West Indies). Does any of this sound like growing up in Michigan?  Have you lived in a state with a state religion?  Texas has one, best characterized as southernbaptistfootball. Recognition that the region is essentially Appalachia with a strong Deep Southern influence and only faint traces of Spanish and Indian influence remaining provides the key to unlock all those scattered observations made as an ignorant but curious youth.<br /><br />Knowing the origins of Yankeedom, the Midlands, Tidewater, and the cavalier South even sheds light on why North Dakotans and Minnesotans, coastal Northern Californians, Oregonians, Washingtonians, and my in-laws in Evanston, Illinois are so similar to New England Yankees, while my prospective in-laws in northern Virginia were deeply interested in our \\""bloodlines\\"".<br /><br />Appalachia and the Deep South were of particular interest to me, but the story of the founding and migrations of El Norte, New England, New Netherland, New France, the Midlands, Tidewater, the Far West, the Left Coast, and more recently the founding of the Canadian First Nation are completely fascinating and illuminating, and leave me embarrassed at how much is new to me.  (Woodard could've made it an even dozen by including New Sweden, a Swedish colony along the Delaware River in parts of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania from 1638 to 1655!  I guess it didn't leave enough of a cultural mark.)<br /><br />Lastly, I did not think Woodard unfairly favored the Yankees; his description showed the harsh, violent, and meddlesome parts of their Puritan cultural heritage along with the elements we still cherish (for much more detail see Fischer's \\""Albion's Seed\\"").  The key difference is that Yankees changed with the times.  Nor did I take the epilogue as an unwelcome interjection of personal opinion.  I read it as unflinching commentary that grappled with unpleasant realities and made some educated extrapolations regarding possible futures for the U.S. and North America.  Woodard is not the first to speculate along these lines of fracture, as he notes.  And I have made the same comments on \\""the Baptist equivalent of sharia law\\"" since the conservative coup of the Southern Baptist Convention in the mid-1990s.  The Deep South has been a reluctant participant in the U.S. federation and has routinely made threats to withdraw since the Articles of Confederation days; in the 2010 mid-term election we again heard southern politicians talk of secession.  That would be either puzzling or shocking without this deep background.  Can a nation-state cobbled together from Dutch, Spanish, French, and multiple waves of incompatible English colonists, along with unwilling Indians and Africans, really hold together for another 200 years?  Maybe a mutual divorce based on irreconcilable differences would eventually result in more compatible second marriages for all or even decisions that they prefer to go it alone.<br /><br />And really lastly - I've enjoyed and learned nearly as much from the reviewers and commenters here as from the book.egonians, Washingtonians, and my in-laws in Evanston, Illinois are so similar to New England Yankees, while my prospective in-laws in northern Virginia were deeply interested in our \\""bloodlines\\"".<br /><br />Appalachia and the Deep South were of particular interest to me, but the story of the founding and migrations of El Norte, New England, New Netherland, New France, the Midlands, Tidewater, the Far West, the Left Coast, and more recently the founding of the Canadian First Nation are completely fascinating and illuminating, and leave me embarrassed at how much is new to me.

8,193260393X,2,"I was overall, very disappointed with this book, after reading the glowing reviews. It left me with many questions that I had to look elsewhere to answer. I was surprised, because this is a lengthy book. However, it seems to be padded with personal stories. The resources section is also lacking with recommendations for further reading (which would have been helpful, considering the amount of questions I had). It just wasn't worth the money."
9,1461164591,5,"Often, you can tell on the first page whether a writer knows what he or she is doing. There's a flow, a grace to the way these writers construct their sentences that makes reading a joy.<br /><br />Ben Wretlind is one of those writers, although his story is anything but joyful. Castles: A Fictional Memoir of a Girl with Scissors, fits into the \\""magic realism\\"" category, although I did not know that when I started reading the book.<br /><br />The story begins with Maggie at age six, living in a trailer on the edge of the desert, somewhere in the US, in fear of dust storms and her drunken, abusive mother. The only light in her life comes from her Grandma, who protects her from her mother's worst and advises the young girl to listen to the voices in the wind. When Grandma dies, Maggie is literally on her own.<br /><br />Maggie learns quickly to stay out of her mother's way, not to engage with her mother's boyfriends and how to \\""clean up her messes.\\"" That's the central theme of the novel.<br /><br />This novel is one of those where you can take the possibly magical elements and view them as only symbolism, and as a childish or psychologically damaged mind's interpretation of strange events. For example, there's the old school bus on the edge of the desert, just outside the trailer park. It's irresistible forbidden adventure to children, whose parents tell them not to go inside for their own good. Of course, the kids can't resist it. It represents forbidden adventure, the dangerous wild beyond the fences, the untameable forces of nature that erode anything made by humans.<br /><br />And it's also a portal to the unknown and to the underworld. You can take it literally or as just the way that Maggie sees it. Beyond the bus is the desert. It periodically sends dust storms that smash through windows and clean up messes.<br /><br />As I said, this is not a joyful book. Maggie is abused by her mother and others, she's raped by her mother's boyfriend, her boyfriend disappears,presumably murdered, her dog is butchered and she takes a series of abusive boyfriends, herself.<br /><br />On the surface, it's a story of a girl in a very hard life, learning how to cope with pain and terror -- how to \\""clean up her mess.\\"" And she also learns how to integrate the unknown terrors of the world beyond the abandoned . Maggie learns also to listen to the wind, finally. And within the wind and the dust storms, she discovers ... well, I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say that within the storms, she finds the agents of just retribution and the strength to clean up her mess and take control of her own life.<br /><br />And yet, you can also read this as the warped interpretation of a woman forced through years of abuse to do ... again, I don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this book. It reminds me of Palahniuk in his darker moments. Wretlind is not afraid to put his readers and his characters through horrible situations, and to describe them clearly, without pretense and without squeamishness. But if you're squeamish, you might have trouble in some parts.<br /><br />Wretlind writes with that fluid, clear, spare style that the big publishing houses all say they demand (and then publish crap that does not adhere to it). So, even though the situation was horrible, Wretlind tells the story very, very well.<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />Highly recommended"
10,0983713006,5,"As one of the best science fiction novels today, The Commission Qi Saga (book 1) delivers a well-thought-of storyline and concept. Its background is interestingly set billions of light years into the future so one can imagine how advanced the technology is, as well as the new attitude of humanity.<br /><br />No matter how advanced the new world order is, however, the problems faced by the people of the new times are still the same things that affect today's mankind. The dark energy that surrounds the Qi universe threatens to wreck havoc to the system, and this results in massive poverty and war just like in the real world.<br /><br />The novel mainly revolves around a set of ancient equations, which somehow predicts the possible destination of mankind and their method of existence. While the so-called \\""Commission\\"" aims to destroy the peace and order of the new dimension, the \\""Brotherhood\\"" has been tasked to fight and protect the rights of the people. And through all of these, the team of Pandora merely hopes to profit from the war and dilemma that engulfs the system.<br /><br />As a reader, I was affected that the fate of the Qi universe seems uncertain. The author was able to give a vivid description of how things are going on in this universe, and the way its impending destruction was described can really be quite disturbing and alarming. It's almost as if my own personal safety is also on the line as with the people of those times.<br /><br />Fortunately, there's hope in all these chaos, as there exists a black mysterious pearl that can turn the dark fate of the universe into something more encouraging and worth looking forward to. And personally, in spite of all the negative forces that prevail in this future world, I still want it saved and reconstructed to fit the existence of human life.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a space adventure saga as it deals with modern technology and existence of futuristic methods. There are suspense, thriller and horror aspectstoo, as the battle of good versus evil happens in this universe too. In spite of the twists and mysteries, however, there are also romantic moments to keep the heart in focus amidst all the wars and confusion.<br /><br />The situation in the Qi universe can be compared to the present situation of mankind and the problems that we are facing today. As such, it raises the question of man's duty and purpose of existence. Moreover, it makes us look into the future with anticipation and caution as our actions will definitely have an impact to future generations.<br /><br />The characters in the book are all realistic, and readers will find it easy to relate and identify with them. Ara, who possesses the black pearl, is the heroine; and she serves as a great inspiration. As the pearl is capable of saving or destroying the universe, it gives readers the opportunity to dwell on the idea on whether it is indeed worth saving or not.<br /><br />El, the other main character of the story, has somewhat lost his faith in the futuristic universe; and we can also relate to his sentiments as we are also seeing the same disheartening problems in our present world.<br /><br />This book is truly a great sci-fi novel, and it is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Just when you think you got it all figured out, the characters behave differently to add more twists and turns to the story. And for that, I commend the author, S. Dawn Nelson. I am a fan of science fiction, and this is one of my favorite books to date."

19,0393972410,5,"As you can see from the various reviews, this is a rather polarizing anthology. I think it's terrific, but it's misleadingly titled (perhaps for sales reasons?) - this is an anthology of North American science fiction from approximately 1960 onward which foregrounds \\""New Wave\\"" and character driven stories.  If that's not what you enjoy, you won't like this book.  You probably won't like it if your politics are conservative, either, since although there are several conservative stories in the book the general trend is left.<br /><br />When I encountered this book in my early twenties, it introduced me to many writers whose work I've enjoyed, from Cordwainer Smith to Zenna Henderson to Joanna Russ.  These are writers who are directly concerned with the social, with language and with experiments in content and form.  Again, if you are looking for hard science fiction (or for rocket ships, lasers and space babes, for that matter) you won't like this book.  If you are looking for a book which traces the change in SF which occurred between the fifties and the eighties, this is an excellent place to start.<br /><br />Deficiencies? Some of the stories are extremely sentimental (\\""Lucky Strike\\"", an alternate history of the bombing of Hiroshima, which frankly makes me tear up but is very heavy-handed). Some of the stories are inexplicably orientalizing/racist (\\""For The Sake of Grace\\"" and the one with the Fanatic!Arab!Assassin!)- which is weird in a book that is obviously intended as progressive/left.  There aren't many stories by writers of color (which were being written - check out Dark Matter if you don't believe me).<br /><br />But honestly, the thing came out sixteen years ago and, I think, consolidated a lot of interest in New Wave and character-driven science fiction.  It seems like today you can find many more anthologies of stories by and about women, people of color and GLBTQ folks.  This anthology has some deficiencies, but I think it served its purpose.<br /><br />When I was a young women who had trouble finding non-conservative SF and stories by women, this book was a godsend.  It opened a lot of doors for me."

You will eat well and have fun!<br /><br />By the way, when you make the chipotle cream (which I highly recommend) you will have a lot of chipotle peppers left over.  Don't waste them.  Whir them all in a blender and then drop teaspoons of them on waxed paper and freeze.  Once frozen, store in plastic bag.  Add to pots of beans or stews as appropriate."

26,1893183246,5,"After determining the subject matter of these books, I ordered them both, wanting to expand my understanding of why things are the way they are, here on our planet.  I received the 2nd one first, and tried to start with it.  Bad idea!  I was obviously over my head with this one!!  Once I received the first volume, it was somewhat easier to wade into, although I wouldn't call either of them an easy read, by any stretch of the imagination!! There were moments of 'brain strain', and I had to take time out to process what I'd read, before diving in again.  What I got out of these writings were validation and hope!!  That what is going on here on our earth goes beyond our corrupt human governments, and that there are positive entities that are working with us to help save our planet from the destructive forces which are so apparent to anyone who is aware, and trying to find a way to counter them. It made comprehending David Icke's writings much easier, and it's all starting to come together and makes more sense than any other explanation I've found to date.  If it weren't for the Voyagers series, I doubt if I could've grasped the bigger picture.  You simply have to break free from the 'reality programming' that we've all been subjected to that go back centuries, think outside the box, and realize that there IS something we can all do to destabilize the dark forces.  It starts with being able to perceive not just our personal life, our city, our state, our nation, our world microcosm, to a much broader reality...one that we've had kept hidden from us.  Once you do that, things start to come into focus and the answers make a lot more sense than the unsatisfactory ones we've been stuck with for so long. David Icke's \\""Remember Who You Are\\"" helps connect the dots, and I highly recommend it, as it concludes with viable solutions we are all capable of. We have to 'know our enemy' and what we can do to disable their agenda. We must rise above all the dark forces, not giving themany power over us.  We can make a crucial contribution to this effort through combining our strength of will, our personal energies and love.

32,0385751605,4,"Also appears on The Screaming Nitpicker.<br /><br />Because of its premise, You Against Me had an abnormally high level of disaster potential. It can take a few small steps to turn a good book into a bad one, but books with higher disaster potential require even fewer steps to go beyond bad and become vile. I didn't have anything to lose (really, I've killed most of my brain cells by this point with other books and it looked so shiny on the bookshelf), so I went for it. I've got to say, I'm impressed. There is a lot it could have done better, but I felt it was a solid novel. I'm glad I took a chance!<br /><br />Downham's near-flawless characterization of Mikey, Ellie, and their families was what made the book. If it hadn't been as well done as it was, You Against Me would have been a clear disaster of a novel. Victim, alleged criminal, family member--the sexual assault is hard on all these characters no matter what their role, nearly tearing two families apart. Some of them are deserving of sympathy--Karyn, for example--and others are not--Tom, who I knew was guilty the minute I read that Karyn was drunk. Someone can't consent to sex if they're as drunk as she was. Mikey and Ellie shine as the main characters trying to do what is best for their families, even if it means doing something wrong.<br /><br />You Against Me is often uncomfortable to read. Is it honest? Yes. Brutal? Very much so. The effect the assault had on Karyn, how it affected Mikey's and Ellie's lives and actions, how people treat all the characters involved, and the loyalties tugging at everyone made it hard to keep reading even when I wanted to. Yet somehow, it also manages to be a little bit warm in the first half as Mikey and Ellie start their small romance. Why only the first half? It got cheesy in the second half and I wasn't quite as into it. Downham's careful handling of a touchy subject kept the novel from being a disaster.<br /><br />Toward the middle of the novel, the character-driven pacing slowed, taking a little longer than it should have to pick back up and bring the reader to the story's natural end. Was it cheesier than felt befitting of the novel? Yeah, it kind of was. The second half was more romance-focused and that weakened it. And whether or not the cop was testing her (I found that a little vague), I found his behavior while questioning Ellie disgusting.<br /><br />On the rampant slut shaming and victim blaming in this book: all of you know how much I hate that stuff. How did I tolerate it when the novel was chock-full of it? It was addressed and it wasn't justified in the end. It should have been more strongly objected to, but it was never made out to be right and that is what really mattered this time. I knew there would be some going on because of the novel's subject; however much I hate it, the treatment of Karyn and Ellie by multiple characters in You Against Me accurately represents what society would do at its current point. If it hadn't happened, I would have cited the novel for being unrealistic.<br /><br />Though its ending was weaker than its beginning, You Against Me was powerful and I will be buying a copy of my own shortly. This is one of those times where I don't feel confident recommending a novel because it's going to come down to whether or not the person feels they can handle it.ing slowed, taking a little longer than it should have to pick back up and bring the reader to the story's natural end.

33,0983069042,5,"You can almost hear your mind's doors screeching open while reading this book.<br /><br />She's been around for the last half-century or so, dancing, learning, travelling, teaching, arguing with people, fighting - at times single-handedly - a noble cause in the name of oriental dance.<br /><br />Although the deluge of cheap, fake, stupid or downright sleazy dancers and shows threatens to drown Morocco's voice, this only strengthens her determination to inform the public about what oriental dance really is, to help dancers understand what it is they are dancing, to make them want to learn more, investigate, and not blindly accept whatever their teacher or their neighbours think. To make them more conscious artists, women and human beings. By propagating the consideration for the culture and knowledge about the dance's history, by being more respectful to their dance, they will get more respect themselves, and their life and work will become more meaningful.<br /><br />I first met Morocco (Aunt Rocky) online, on that defunct M.E.D. List, and absorbed with relish all she had to say, which often was a revelation to me. That's why I consider her one of my most important teachers, although I've never taken an actual lesson with her (apart from a weekend seminar, but that was choreographies). And, in that sense, she might also be considered the teacher of my own students, since I'm now passing on the information. As well as admiration and respect for this amazing woman: an intelligent, passionate, opinionated, resourceful, creative, thorough, and immensely funny lady whom I love from the bottom of my heart and I'll always feel close to, even if I should never meet her again in my life. She has been a tremendous influence for me as for uncountable others, and I feel I've become richer (only in the figurative sense, though, LOL) because of her being in this world.<br /><br />Still, as much as she's been teaching, in her studio, in online lists and articles,conferences and ininnumerable seminars abroad, how many can have access to her teachings and benefit from her huge experience? And - touch wood! - will she be around forever? Who can pass on all of that knowledge to the next generation of dancers? We all have some bits, but only she has the whole thing.<br /><br />That's why a book was a necessity. The organizing of such vast material must have seemed a huge chore to someone who is not a professional writer, so the format chosen was a clever way out. An introduction to the chapter or subchapter, and then a Q and A, based on the saved email exchanges that we lovingly remember. Plus filling up on whatever subjects hadn't been covered on the list, inserting stories, anecdotes, even full articles and interviews.<br />She does cover almost everything one would ever wish to know about the subject - including some things we didn't know we wished to know, and a huge chunk of info on folkloric dances (she calls it raqs Shaabi, not to be confused with the urban Shaabi style) which have little to do with Oriental dance and thus will surely not be of much interest to at least half of the dancers. But it had to be there, as so many dancers and show organizers now are seeking, for variety's sake, to include some of them in their performances. Being a relatively new addition, it is a candidate of mis-interpretation, and as such, a candidate of Morocco's saving campaign.<br /><br />Here is what you'll find in the book:<br />1. It starts with an introduction and a short biography - too short in my opinion, but maybe she's saving the juicy parts for a separate book, who knows?<br />2 and 3.  The two chapters about Shaabi (folk dances) and Sharqi/Oryantal. Discussing the different styles, what is done where, what is authentic and what is invented, giving definitive answers. When she talks about Taheya Carioca and how she got her name, it's Carioca herself who told her. When she says that Mahmoud Reda invented Melaya Leff, it's from Reda's lips that she has it. And so on. So you can relax and be sure, and read on, knowing that you can trust completely what you read.<br />4. The next chapter, \\""Over There\\"", is very useful. What is happening in the countries of origin of the dance? How is the situation now, how are they thinking about the dance, what are the conditions for dancers? Where to go, how to act, what to expect, what to shop for if you want to travel there?<br />5. The next chapter is called \\""Nuts and Bolts\\"" and is divided into Teaching, Techniques, Finger Cymbals and Working. No, it does not teach you technique, but it does give invaluable pointers, and discusses most issues that people will come across as students, teachers and/or professionals, including what to look for in a good teacher, a safe position of the hands when playing finger cymbals to avoid tendinitis at this age of PC use, whether and how to accept tips, how to organize a seminar and so on.<br />6. The Cautionary Tales, Personal Encounters and Revelations will help you be wary of and avoid the many pitfalls in your way, but also flesh out the scant biography section because here she recounts her meetings with great dancers/choreographers or people relevant to the dance history.<br />7. What's in a name? A lot, according to Morocco, and it's because of her, mainly, that so many of us are avoiding the offensive \\""b\\"" word in favour of Raqs Sharqi or its translation, Oriental dance - even if we all use them in the tags of our youtube videos and in the keywords of our websites, well knowing that the public will usually not search for the politically correct name but for the misnomer.<br />8. Images. A few pictures, some never previously available to the general public, with the authentic costuming of folk dances.<br />9. Glossary. Indispensable, even the most knowledgeable will find a word he/she didn't know.<br />10. Bibliography. A very fat bibliography, 5,5 big pages long, containing old print classics but also some web resources and videos.<br />11. Index. Very useful, considering the wealth of material in the book.<br />12. About the Author. All the awards and recognitions and nice things that she couldn't put in her bio written in the first person.<br /><br />So, a really comprehensive reference book. What I didn't mention is that, while being exact and scholarly, it's exceptionally well-written, pleasant, witty and to the point, even anectodes are no idle chat, they have a reason of being there. It has the flavour of real conversation, and goes down sweetly, so that even non-bookish dancers will enjoy perusing at least parts of it, if the size of it doesn't feel threatening to them. So yes, even if you haven't ever read anything other than Cosmo in your life, don't hesitate, give it a go, you'll not regret it!"

I first read it 40 years ago while pursuing a major in the Mother Department, Philosophy, natch and when one of my profs recommended it I took to it like a duck to water.

40,0140244751,5,Smokers and non-smokers alike should read this book to understand the smoking trap!  I read his first book and stopped smoking for 10 months without too much trouble but fell for the trap of thinking I could just have one.  Wrong!!!! Before long I was smoking full time again.  Am in the process of reading this one to get off again.  Allen really opens your eyes and explains things so well.  It's funny and sad to read all the excuses we use to continue smoking and how each excuse is explained as DUMB!  It's a long book and repeats things alot but we need these things beat into our heads that smoking is nothing but a filthy addiction!
41,1401340873,5,"It's hard to believe that this is a work of fiction -- it's intimately peopled with characters so real, I could make them a cup of chamomile tea and a soy cheese enchilada, and they would eat it.  Now that I've finished it, I miss them.<br /><br />I listened to the excellent recorded book version of this book.  I revisited childhood, more vividly than I remember my own.  I struggled, as I once did in real life, with the wish to believe in a charismatic, inspiring, and narcissistic guru, and the confusing disillusionment that follows, if you're lucky.<br /><br />There were so many interesting little threads carried through the book, artfully reappearing like actual memories, but with better timing.  Mysteries were solved deliciously, from treasures unearthed from the dust in an abandoned mansion, to how to cherish a fleeting breath in a chaotic world.<br /><br />The author wasn't even born in the hippie era that forms the foundation of the story.  How on earth did she nail the details of commune-speak, addiction, raising teenagers, caring for aging parents?  She must be a kid genius: a master of \\""show, don't tell,\\"" even though her medium is words.<br /><br />Another reviewer was reluctant to believe that a naked 5-year-old could help a laboring woman through childbirth.  I found that sensuous birth scene entirely believable, though I'm sure it might shock some readers.  A laboring woman is sensitive to the energy of people in the room with her, and extremely sensitive to touch and smell.  I could see how a gentle, cuddly, familiar child could be just the right medicine, and I could imagine his satisfaction at being so helpful.  The one thing that struck me as fanciful was the behavior of the doctor late in the book.  I won't spoil it by going into detail, but I thought it was maybe too good to be true.  But I was happy to suspend my disbelief for that -- it COULD happen, in the kind of Utopia that gurus can only hope for.<br /><br />I have always thought that writingabout the past and present without acknowledging the hell-in-a-handbasket forebodings of modern life is naive or maybe irresponsible.  But in a book about wishful thinking, Groff has managed to tackle our likely dystopian future as well.  The main character evolves, bit by little bit, from believing in a sort of magic to celebrating reality.  I am enriched.  This book will be a tough act to follow."
42,190811715X,2,"I don't really understand why people rate books with four or five stars just because they liked them (obviously), despite their many shortcomings. The Lightning Boys is a fine example of this star-inflation!<br /><br />This is a book mostly written by over 20 former Lightning pilots (Pike was one of them), each one of them contributing with one very short story (or should I rather say anecdote?), the kind of story you might hear at the pub with a pint in your hand. The hardcover version is nicely printed with glossy paper and an interesting collection of mostly color pictures. Nevertheless, there are too many pictures cramped in the small pages, resulting in many printed so small that their value becomes rather irrelevant. In this format, I would have stuck to 2 pictures per page with a good caption.<br /><br />Unfortunately, all the stories can be summarized as: I was flying, I heard a loud 'bang', and something terrible happened (usually fire in the engine compartment), but I somehow made it back - times 20!<br /><br />Almost all the stories are very shallow and short, and don't tell you much about the Lightning, their crews, the RAF during the height of the cold war, or anything else for that matter, with a couple of exceptions. That is the biggest problem with this book. The author should have stuck with maybe 5 - 10 stories, but expand each to encompass a broader description, including some more technical information and more detailed descriptions of the (supposedly) main subject of the book, the marvelous Lightning.<br /><br />The title of the book says it all, this is just a recollection of true tales from pilots of the Lightning, told in a very straightforward and rather succinct manner.<br /><br />When you read a book and find the appendix more entertaining and informative than the main body, than something is just not right. For the price I wouldn't recommend this book, there are much more informative and authoritative books about the Lightning out there."

He is being put out to pasture.<br /><br />THE SCARECROW is a gripping, terrifying read with all the masterful prose of Connelly. I really enjoyed it overall, but found the ending weak.

When he left, all she ever wanted was for him to return home even though she never wanted him to leave. Asking her to marry him before he left gave her something to hope for along with a promise he'd come back to her.<br /><br />Now that he has, he doesn't want to see her. Asks her not to come visit or see him. Yet Jane's still in love with Seth and can't understand how his feelings have changed for her until she makes a trip to visit him.

On the fifth floor, she enters his room and finds him looking so much worse than she ever expected. Losing much of the weight he had before, she braced herself for his reaction. When he looked up at her, she expected to see love in his eyes, but now only anger appeared there. He was mad she had gone against his wishes and come to see him.<br /><br />He tells Jane that he wants her to forget about him, to take the engagement ring she's still wearing and sell it. Take a trip, go on a cruise. He's not here for her anymore. Only Jane thinks she has prepared herself in the last six months to deal with Seth. After everything she has read, she still has hope that they can still be married, she still is in love with him and wants to be his wife.

If this Series didn't exist, some great writer would have to invent it. I loved Al Kaline's amazing performance and wonderful modesty. I loved Freehan's blocking the plate and Northrup's triple over the head of Curt Flood. Most of all, I loved Mickey Lolich. I don't care if the Tigers ever win another series, I have mine and it's called \\""1968.\\""<br /><br />This book, though flawed (I agree with all the criticisms of the other reviewers), is a great recreation of that Series in the bizarre context that was the United States during the summer of 1968. As I read, the feeling came back to me: the fear and anxiety of that year, as well as the mounting anger, as we watched thousands of soldiers head out for Vietnam.  Wendel does a good job in taking us back (and I do appreciate his inclusion of Peabody and Sherman's WABAC machine!).<br /><br />I will say that his style seems at times difficult and poorly developed. I also wondered where the editors were when I came upon weird juxtapositions or passages that seemed purely non-sequitur in nature. Also, the author harbors a secret bias for the Cardinals that annoyed me after awhile. He seems to make excuses for the Cardinals' inability to win their fourth game, rather than credit the Tigers with tremendous spirit and tenacity. He was more explicit with this when I heard him read at a bookstore recently (although I thoroughly enjoyed his reading, as well). This is especially evident when he discusses Curt Flood's \\""slip\\"" as he went after Northrup's triple; he threw in every excuse in the book: white shirted background, loose turf, etc.  Jim Northrup played out there, too, and Kaline and Horton. I didn't see them slip. Those shirts were there for them, too. Let's give the Tigers some credit here (he loves playing up the Namath football upset, but seems to begrudge the Tigers their victory).<br /><br />Tiger fans, beware, but also, read this book; it's perhaps not as \\""Tiger-centric\\"" as the great work: The Tigers of '68: Baseball's Last Real Champions (George Cantor), but it IS highly readable, entertaining and has an \\""angle\\"" (i.e. discussing the Series in the political and social context of American life in 1968) that I find very rewarding. Still, I'd give my entire baseball library for the chance to shake hands with Mickey Lolich."
48,1448921384,5,"Every training and development professional in a corporation should read this book.  Corporations are full of people who think anyone can be a training and development professional and thus put unqualified people into managing them.  Then they are shocked when the efforts fall short.  What John experienced during his tenure at Chrysler/Daimler Chrysler is an all too familiar occurrence throughout corporations.  It is truly amazing how John kept his sanity amidst all the insanity that was the DaimlerChrysler Academy.  As a training and development professional, I can relate to the struggles John encountered.  \\""A Corporate Education\\"" is an excellent read for anyone who is trying to create a learning organization within their company."

This book made a lot of teens want to read this book, and want to go see the movie. I like how the author described a lot of the outline of all of the districts, and how their lives were, before really starting the book. Also, I absolutely love the battle scene. All the weapons in the middle, and the descriptions of all the weapons and the surrounding landscape, I thought was a very great part of the book. This is a fantastic book, and I recommend this book to everyone who loves adventure, and fighting books. Also, if you like this book, I recommend the book Legend. I hope you enjoyed this review, and have a great day. I hope you chose to read this book, because it is AMAZING!!!"
53,1587672561,5,"James Hastings is a Ghost. Not a ghost, ghost. A version of Ghost. Because of his resemblance to the mega rap star, James's job is to throw off paparazzi and make appearances when Ghost can't. But when James's wife dies in a freak accident, he decides it's time to retire. Embracing his old self but consumed by the loss of Stacey, a year goes by with James drinking away the time. Then things begin to change. A new neighbor moves in next door and with her, James becomes convinced that Stacey may never have left. Strange noises in the house, Stacey's clothes and shoes reappearing. And it all goes downhill from there.<br /><br />I loved this book! Ghost stories are super fun and Ransom threw in some twists and surprises in the plot that brought this book to a whole new level. If you can get your hands on it, I highly recommend KILLING GHOST (pubbed in the UK as THE HAUNTING OF JAMES HASTINGS): perfect rainstorm read, great summer chiller, and one that actually had me looking over my shoulder in the middle of the night!<br /><br />Horror fans, this is an author you need to be reading!

57,0062194437,1,"As I browsed the books I was so relieved to find that there is a market for a book by a criminal who claims redemption.<br />Twenty years ago Rodney King was a thug criminal who admits he ran from the cops because HE was drunk and didn't want to lose the job he held after getting out of jail. What he doesn't tell you and what for some reason was never admitted in court is he was also on PCP which he tested positive for when he was taken to the hospital.<br />He also forgets the fact that of the 56 or 57 swings that were administered to him only a few actually made contact. If I would have been that officers supervisor that night he would have went back to train better with the PR-24.<br />Rodney King claims they were just having \\""fun\\"" by beating him. Think what you want of the LAPD but we never went out looking to beat up minorities. In fact, if the poor down trodden Rodney \\""Can't we all just get along\\"" King would have pulled over none of that would have happened. In fact, if you watch the entire video you will notice that his passengers put their hands on their head and complied with the police requests and did not get hurt so if the police truly wanted to have fun and beat suspects then they could have beat them all.<br />What has bothered me for years is why all those officers could not have taken him into custody without having to do all the non-sense that happened that night. I have, with the help of a partner, taken guys much worse than that degenerate. In the years since this incident King has had numerous run-ins with the law and lives in the worst area of Rialto, California which would not be the place I would live if I had won $3 million in a lawsuit. I wish I could believe that Rodney King was changed and redeemed himself in some way but I know better. Rodney has obviously ran out of money and found another way to scrounge money from a all too gullible public. Look for this book to be in the bargain or clearance section very soon."

59,0307729656,3,"Description:<br /><br />  Alisa Harris was brought up to be a politically conservative-Republican Christian, her views of faith and politics tightly linked. She picketed abortion clinics and protested the war in Iraq because of her belief that the USA had strayed from the teachings of God, and the only way to redeem itself would be to put the right people and laws into power. Her parents, church, religious community, and education (home school through college) molded her into the person [they] wanted her to be, but her interactions with the outside world pushed her to question certain aspects of her faith-driven politics. Seeing the world from different perspectives allowed her to stay true to her core belief system, but separate her faith from her political background. Can faith and politics mix? Or are they better off on opposite sides of debate? Alisa tries to determine her real feelings about the past and future of her beliefs.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />  I was raised 'middle' - middle child and center of the christian/political spectrum - not 'right', nor 'left'; but I understand where Alisa Harris is coming from. I am well aware that many people/organizations try to indoctrinate their children with whatever beliefs they hold in order to plant the seeds for the next generation of believers in the cause. I have many friends and family members that think in that exact way: My parents are Republican/ Democrat, so I must vote Republican/ Democrat, (even if I don't believe in it...), or My family doesn't believe in gay marriage or abortion, so I guess I should oppose it too... Isn't growing up about discovering our own stances, and finding out what we (the individual) truly believe in? I do not believe in passing down political convictions (or discriminations). That is why I enjoyed reading about Alisa's journey, because she started viewing politics and religion from different angles and making her own judgments. Do I think she completely \\""untangled\\"" herself from the faith/politics \\""knot\\"" her childhood tied? Not totally, but free-thought is a start. I found her memoir well-written, though disjointed at times; I expected the normal progression from childhood through adult, but her experiences were frequently mixed, switching from kid to college student. Her recall of the past was told in a story-like fashion, and I appreciated Alisa's attitude throughout.

60,1440530122,5,"I'm surprised that there are only a handful of reviews for this book.  Then again, maybe it should be no surprise that no one has read it? As of 2012, America has graduated thousands of young people into a job market that isn't hiring. Many of these same graduates are holding mortgage-sized educational loan debt. I think its time to question things. I am astonished that the higher-education bubble isn't making front page headlines.  Ordinary tax payers should probably read this book too.  If you want to get mad at your government's fiscal irresponsibility, this book has fun introducing you to our goofy federal student aid program. Yes,government doesn't think twice about spending other people's money, penalizing savers, and encouraging youngsters to take on unrealistic debt. My guess is that our government wants the American public to be deep in debt (interest supplies revenue).  This system is leveraging itself against America's future. Economically it is unsustainable. I can't imagine how America can build a strong knowledge economy if our population cannot access higher education without paying through the nose for it.  We can't generate a strong economy if our future graduates are under/unemployed, broke, or halted from continuing education.<br /><br />If you have a child, it is in your best interest to read this book.  It can be skimmed through in less than an evening of your time. It contains very valuable information that can save you thousands of dollars. High school students should read it (college is ultimately your game, not your parents).<br /><br />Anyone wanting to get a glimpse on how the higher education industry really works, should read this book. I'm noticing that the majority of Americans have no idea that an outrageously expensive scam is in business at these schools all across the country (identically mirrors the sub-prime mortgage mess). Students naively waltz into college with full faith that the schools exist to help them achieve their dreams. But, once you remove the smoke and mirrors? Colleges aren't living up to the hype that society continues to unquestionably believe. Colleges are more or less concerned with generating revenue more than anything else. Students and parents need to be business-minded when playing the college game.  That means that you need to have your ultimate goals in mind, cut your expenses, avoid loans like the plague, and maximize every opportunity you can during your college experience.  The more you know, the better. This book can help you out."

66,0882823744,5,"This book is one that I absolutely could not put down, more suspenseful and engaging than any fictional crime tales could possibly be.  It was terrifying to learn from Richard Jaffe, with his unique perspective gained from many years of murder trial defense, how flawed some aspects of our justice system are, and how real the possibility that circumstantial evidence and sloppy or dishonest police work could send an innocent person to Death Row.  Particularly one who is poor and does not have access to a first-class lawyer.  Mr. Jaffe is a humanitarian who lives his ideals, and the eloquent anti-death penalty message he conveys in \\""Quest for Justice\\"" is totally convincing.  I hope we shall see more of his work soon."
67,0800794931,5,"I've just finished reading Kris's book, and I have to say that it is truly excellent. I have been going through some heavy spiritual warfare the last 2 months, and this book arrived in my life right on time. It is very practical and helped me learn how to engage in spiritual warfare wearing the full armour of God, whilst living in God's love as His royal Son. Every single chapter covers a different area or topic, but all are linked together. It is a HIGH IMPACT book that I would highly recommend. Even if you are not going through spiritual warfare right at the moment, I would truly recommend it all the more highly. It will prepare you for a part of the Christian life that is inevitable if you are really pleasing God. If you are feeling persecuted by the enemy and being spiritually attacked, you must be doing something right in God's Kingdom! Taking ground for Jesus, pisses off the Devil. Changed my life and my perspective. Thanks Kris!"

76,0307717429,5,"I acquired Richard Wolffe's book after being impressed, night after night, by his succinct and thoughtful words, which unpacked potentially thorny topics quietly, succinctly and effectively. Initially, a louder, more dramatic and forceful rhetoric by a \\""bigger\\"" physical presence was needed to reclaim for nightly news an alternative voice, and Keith Olbermann supplied it (not Chris Matthews), making possible, perhaps for the first time since the Carter years, the use of the word \\""liberal\\"" without fear of instant reprisal.  Olbermann's defection (apparently his ego outsized his on-screen presence) left a void--but it also cleared the stage for cooler (and humbler) heads like Wolffe's.<br /><br />Wolffe's unimposing stature and efficient but even-measured elocution in effect direct the viewer's attention to his language, unassisted by bullhorns and unadorned by personal charm.  It's that emphasis on economy, craftsmanship, and balance that makes Wolffe's account of our current President--his successes and failures, challenges and responses, strengths and weaknesses--compelling reading on the subject.  The other night when, on the \\""Ed Shultz Show,\\"" he was asked to defend Jimmy Carter (from a gratuitous dissing by the Republican candidate) with five seconds remaining, Wolffe sized up the space like a master carpenter, deftly delivering a concrete answer that was neither a word (nor a second) too long or short: \\""Bush gave us Iraq: Jimmy Carter in a single term gave us Camp David.\\""<br /><br />Admittedly, Wolffe is an apologist for Obama; in fact, he doesn't pretend NOT to be an admirer of the President--unlike books that purport to be \\""objective\\"" before betraying a flagrant bias and specific agenda.  But more importantly, he respects the reader's intelligence and limited time.  Americans tend to feel ambivalence if not inferiority in the presence of commentators who, like Wolffe, are British-born and Oxford-educated.  But when the words are on the page, there is no accent to bathe them in colors that obstruct their meanings.  In this context, Wolffe is a journalist who has few peers in bringing a subject to life, removing the medium of the author in favor of the transparency of his carefully chosen words.to bathe them in colors that obstruct their meanings.

77,0805092560,4,"Jay is a freshman dealing with the typical angst that plagues teenage boys. Raging hormones, unrequited feelings for his best friend, bully problems, and all the awkwardness that comes with being a teenager. His burdens become heavier when his parents announce they are separating on a trial basis. His dad is a workaholic and not home much. Consequently, his mother started up an affair with a low life, who just happens to be the father of one of his friends. Things go from bad to worse as Jay grapples with his family being torn apart, his arch nemesis, Mike, continues his ruthless taunts, Cameo, his best friend and love interest starts dating another dirt bag and he fails miserably in the debate for class president. There is a sliver of light at the end of the tunnel. A new girl, Caroline, comes to town and he forms a fast relationship with her. Will Jay somehow survive his unpleasant and geeky teenage years?<br />Three and a half stars: A witty tale of a teenage boy coping with teenage and adult drama.<br /><br />What I Liked:<br />*This is one of those books you grab when you are in the mood for a mindless, funny read. It is a novel full of everything you expect when following a somewhat nerdy teenage boy: bathroom humor, loads of sexual references, awkwardness and plenty of hilarious antics. This is a book you can pick up and put down because the plot is simplistic and perfect for days when your mind is tired.<br />*I loved being in Jay's head. There are so many funny and witty comments in this book that will have you snorting and laughing out loud (seriously the type where you really do laugh, none of that fake LOL crap when you don't mean it). For whatever reason I enjoy following the ridiculous thought process of a teenage boy. Be prepared for loads of crude bathroom references (Jay suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and non stop thoughts on sex as well as self deprecating type remarks. This book will introduce you to many new sexual euphemisms and innuendos. If you are not the type that appreciates teenage boy humor, this book is not for you.<br />*While on the surface this book is billed as a humorous book I appreciate that it dealt with some very real issues. There are three characters, Jay, Cameo and Caroline, who have parents with some major problems. Jay and his sister Abby are dealing with the break up of their family due to their mother's infidelity. I liked watching how each of the siblings grappled with the situation differently and how they experienced a gamut of emotions. Especially for Jay the feelings he has regarding the issue are interesting. At the end I applauded his mature decision when new allegations come to light. The way he confronts his mother and deals with the problem show a marked growth and new found maturity.<br />*I loved the relationship between Jay and his sister Abby. Abby as a senior,of course,is obsessed with her boyfriend, popularity and cell phone, and her brother is the least of her concerns. As the events unfurl, the two bond and rediscover the importance of sibling relationships. The way Abby nonchalantly looks out for her little brother is adorable. I loved the late night floor sleep overs and the phone texts that Jay uses to get his sister's attention and most of all the way she fiercely protects him, but don't tell her friends that. This was my favorite aspect of the story.<br />*I liked how on the chapters are a play on real song titles which the author lists at the end of the book. You get such gems as: \\""Dad Likes Her Butt And He Cannot Lie\\"", \\""I Just Called To Say I'm Pooping\\"", \\""Give Me One Reason Not To Shoot Myself In The Face.\\"" These are: \\""Baby Got Back\\"", Sir Mix A Lot, \\""I Just Called To Say I Love You\\"", Stevie Wonder and \\""Give Me One Reason\\"", Tracy Chapman.<br />*Finally, I mentioned in some of my previous reviews that coming of age books where characters deal with some major issues and at the end exhibit marked growth are some of my favorite reads. I thoroughly enjoyedthe steps toward maturity that Jay takes and the way he comes to terms with the issues surrounding his family. Also I admired how he reconciles his feelings regarding Caroline and Cameo, and the resolution of his ongoing feud with Mike where he discovers they might have more in common than they realized. At the end you can chart his progress and see he is on his way to becoming a more mature adult... well he is trying, I doubt he will give up his bathroom/sex jokes.<br />And The Not So Much:<br />*One of my big issues in this book was that it is kind of all over. There is no clear plot line. You get a bunch of random scenes that flicker all over the map. It does not follow a neat, cohesive story line. The humor spices it up and keeps you entertained but more than a few times the jokes went over my head because they felt more like inside jokes and they were often lost on me.<br />*I wish Jay's father was more involved. In the beginning he has a main role but as the story progresses he is absent, a background character. Jay's mother is a strong presence and you get to see her viewpoint which I liked, I wish his father's perspective was shown. I would have liked to know his father's reaction to his mother's final revelation.<br />*I wanted a bit more resolution of the parental issues that Caroline and Cameo faced. Both girls dealt with difficult situations and I would like to see how they settled out; especially for Cameo, her home life was a mess.<br /><br />The Educmacation of Jay Baker is an entertaining read that explores the angst and drama in an average teenage boy's life. It is ridiculous and full of crude humor and sexual references. It is not all fun and games, though. This book depicts a young man learning that his parents aren't the models of perfection he always believe them to be. They are human and fallible just like everyone else. If you are not the type (a deviant like me) that appreciates this type of humor then this is not a book for you. If you want something light, funny but also a book with mature changes pick this one up.<br /><br />Favorite Quotations:<br /><br />\\""Eyebrows raised, Dad was looking might surprised by my sudden rebellious streak.

78,0743264487,2,"Don't buy this one. Really. I'm baffled by the good reviews. I am newly diagnosed as ADD, and of the handful of books I've read so far, this was easily the most condescending and least useful. It is written on an 8th grade level, with loads of examples of fake character studies accompanied by \\""lessons\\"" that are beyond obvious. For example, we meet \\""Bob,\\"" who has trouble with interpersonal relationships because he is always interrupting people. The advice the authors give is, if you resemble \\""Bob,\\"" you should remind yourself to let the other person finish speaking before you speak.<br /><br />The authors concede several times that they are not therapists or psychologists, just people with ADD. What they fail to add is that they aren't very good writers.<br /><br />A better choice is to read \\""Driven to Distraction\\"" -- it's way better written, has much more information, and won't condescend to you in such an exasperating and tedious way. I also liked \\""Healing ADD.\\"""

I never liked Henry James. So maybe that is part of my issue. The central character is pathetic. Of course so is the central character in \\""Dirt.\\"" But Bea grates on me.

It is my favorite book of all time and I use it as a resource when ever I feel stuck on a thought or worry.<br /><br />I have bought this book for close friends and I think anyone who reads this book can find something  they can use in their own life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to make their life better by focusing on the positive and bringing more good stuff in their lives.

It gives suggestions for countless trips of one day to two weeks, detailing everything there is to see and do, how much time is required at each stop, and how to get to the next destination.<br /><br />The book can be a bit confusing, since one attraction may be listed in many places under different side trips, but reading the entire book page by page is a joy, at once both exhilarating and exhausting, as you daydream of seeing all the beauty, charm, and history Great Britain has to offer.  Highly recommended."

86,042524735X,4,"The Girls Guide to Man Hunting by Jessica Clare<br />Contemporary Romance  -May 1st, 2012<br />4 stars<br /><br />Goodgirl Miranda Hill has lived years of shame when Dane Croft posted pictures of her `exposed' on the internet.  It is a scandal that continues to haunt her as the `Boobs of Bluebonnet.'  Since Miranda lives in a small town that knows everyone and everything this has made her life very rough.  To make matters worse Dane just left town after the fallout to become a big athletic star.<br /><br />But now Dane is back and sweet Miranda has decided she wants revenge.  She plans to seduce him and post pictures of him in a compromising situation!  Now he will know how she has felt being humiliated.  She has the perfect opening because Dane has opened up a survival school and she has signed up to get close to him.  But what happens when she starts falling for Dane all over again?  Can she hurt him like he hurt her or will she have a change of heart?<br /><br />Dane can't believe Miranda Hill, the sexy girl he knew of nine years ago has signed up for his school.  She is sexier than ever.  But something feels off, she isn't quite the same trusting girl he used to know and Dane is determined to make her his own.<br /><br />This fun, light read is super steamy as Miranda pursues Dane with surprising results.  Miranda is torn between loving Dane and reminding herself of all the reasons not to trust, the lying, deceitful backstabber!  She can't believe she is falling for his old tricks again.<br /><br />Any reader will root for Miranda, who wouldn't want a little payback after years of humiliation?  But for her to fall so quickly for Dane again seemed a bit fast and seemed improbable.  Otherwise, I liked that Miranda stayed true to her character.  It was fun to read Miranda twist Dane with her newfound seductress skills.  On the other hand, Dane is a decent if sometimes rather clueless hero.  But I liked how his character changed and how he proves himself worthy of Miranda's tender heart at the end.<br /><br />Fast, easy to read this contemporary romance is filled with misunderstanding and lots of steamy sex to keep readers amused and entertained.<br /><br />Reviewed by Steph from the Bookaholics Romance Book Club"

88,0199538212,5,"This big book was first serialized between 1855 and 1857. I can imagine people waiting for the next installment and talking with their friends about the story and their hopes for what the characters will do next. I know when I was young we used to talk about TV shows in this way, too. Do people still do that? For me, the talking with others about stories is a great thing. Everyone is better off for having done it.<br /><br />\\""Little Dorrit\\"" is described as a social satire and it does have wonderfully biting things to say about society, about government (the \\""circumlocution office\\"") and petty bureaucrats, and it even has a kind of Bernie Madoff scandal in it that any reader who lived through that scandal can relate to easily. But, for me, there is a lot more art to this work than just its very funny humor and more than half-crazy plot.<br /><br />I know that this novel gets a lot of criticism. But I really loved reading it. People complain about its convoluted plot, and I guess if that is what I was reading it for I would have to admit that the plot, especially at the end, seems forced and more complicated than it needed to be. A bit self-indulgent. But I don't think the story itself is the point of the book. As I read this book I was floored by the beauty of several scenes that will remain with me always. Little Dorrit's \\""Party\\"". Clenham's facing his maturity and placing the roses in the river and watching them float away with his youth. The scene where Amy's father has asked Clenham if he might go for a walk outside the walls and Arthur replies that he cannot, but it will only be a few more hours. And Mr. Dorrit replies, \\""A few hours, sir,\\"" he returned with a sudden passion. \\""You talk very easily of hours, sir! How long do you suppose, sir, that an hour is to a man who is choking for want of air?\\"" The true power of that line is revealed solely because we have spent so much time with the man and the mask he has worn for decades in the Marshalsea. He has worn it not to deceive anyone, for who could be deceived, but to survive there. And to see it taken off just then is stunning. And, for me, the greatest scene in the book is towards the end when the other prisoners comment on the nobility of Amy versus the assumed nobility of \\""society\\"". There are many other wonderful scenes, but these are just a few of my most favorite.<br /><br />As I read the book I came to see it as a story about character. Dickens uses the plot to put the people of the story in very different circumstances and their character is revealed to us by how they act in those circumstances. And, for me, this was the truly important aspect of the book. Frankly, the book enriched me. And this is the kind of art I love best. Not to pass the time. Not to distract me. But to allow me to feel that my life is richer and has more substance because I experienced this art. I don't really care that the plot has certain implausible aspects to it. I care deeply that I got to watch these people demonstrate who they truly are because they believed in the reality of the story and acted sincerely within it.<br /><br />I think these illustrations also add a lot to the story. Of course, I had to use a magnifying glass to fully enjoy them, but I wasn't in a hurry to get through this work. And also found it wonderfully enjoyable to look up words about clothes and carriages and activities of the time I did not know. And the way Dickens uses English is marvelous. I found myself looking up the etymology of some words to just dig into the richness of how Dickens was using words that I found less familiar or the usage seemed different to me. Of course, Dickens is one of the writers from whom the rules are made so we should get used to him and reorder our own thinking about our language with his striking richness of words.<br /><br />I hope you take the time to read this novel. Not only is it far superior to most of what is written today. It remains far superior to much of what has been written at any time.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MIten at any time.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI"

They still have the cute pictures that the bigger books do but are made for a younger audience. They're board books so they hold up well to her holding it, turning pages, and dropping it when she's done. The rhymes in it are cute and easy to read. We read Nighty-Night before going to bed and Wakey-Wake comes with us in the diaper bag. So, if your kids are older I'd stick with the picture books but this is a perfect way to introduce toddlers to Llama llama."
90,0765330083,4,"Walter Mosely brings us two novels in one: The Gift of Fire and On the Head of a Pin. Both are science fiction/fantasy novels that are a joy to read. 'm not a fan of science fiction novels, and I don't think that will change, however, I was intrigued and entertained by these two novels. They were well-written, and in the 100 or so pages of each novel, I found myself sucked into that world.<br />In The Gift of Fire, the god Prometheus, tired of being tortured, walks in to the mortal world to find a suitable vessel for the second gift of fire (enlightenment). Found wandering around the streets of South Center LA, Prometheus is arrested. While in jail, he makes a connection that leads him to a young crippled boy, Chief Reddy. Chief becomes the carrier of the light and the enemy of the gods.<br />In On the Head of a Pin, Joshua Winterland works as a record keeper for JTE and their ground breaking project, the Blank Page. It starts out as a way to have current and past actors perform together during any period of time. One evening the Sail (the screen of the Blank Page) takes on a life of its own depicting images even when the screen is not connected. Josh becomes astutely attuned to the screen making him not only an important man to the government, but an important man to race of people hundreds of years in the future.<br />Both novels are thought-provoking and eye-opening. Each novel raises questions about love, religion, time, life, death, souls, and spirituality. I am a fan of Walter Mosely, and he does not disappoint with these two novels."

But now, in \\""Crusade\\"", the Grik have planned an all-out assault against Reddy, USS Walker, and the Lemurians.  Plus, the Grik have another huge advantage; The Japanese ship Amagi, which was fighting with Walker and Mahan before they entered the mysterious storm, has also been sucked in and is now operating with the Grik.  Will Amagi be enough to turn the tide against Reddy, Walker, and Mahan?<br /><br />I've really enjoyed the first two books of the \\""Destroyermen\\"" series.  The characters are well-developed, and the story is exciting.  I'm a fan of science fiction and World War II history, so I get the best of both worlds in this series.

Assuming the worst, if for no other reason that Gunter has been able to hold on to his position as a homicide investigator in a land where the political rulers are the principal murderers Gunter arrives in Prague in the company of a beautiful hat check girl from a Berlin nightclub.<br /><br />Once at the castle, Gunter is soon confronted by the murder of Heydrich's fourth adjutant, a young SS officer from Heydrich's hometown. The murder occurs in a locked room (with appropriate homages to Agatha Christy along the way), and the list of suspects includes some of the biggest names in the Nazi party. Gunter is given free rein to investigate and along the way manages to insult some of the biggest creeps in a party of creeps, thugs and serial killers. It is great fun.<br /><br />In every good mystery however, things are never quite what they seen and the subplot, the pursuit of Czech terrorists begins to take a life of its own. This work however must be taken in its larger context: how can the rule of law be enforced in such a world? Indeed, how can any moral individual survive?<br /><br />These are the great questions that arise within the pages of Prague Spring. There is no clear answer to them, and that is how it should be."

At first, the different subplots don't seem to tie together, but the author does a great job of bringing them together as the book wraps up.<br /><br />Since I live in the Pacific Northwest, I especially appreciated the fact that the book is set (largely) in the Portland, Oregon area.  The author's use of known landmarks in Portland really add a great amount of color to the work, and make it all that much more readable.<br /><br />The plot centers around a woman who has allegedly killed her friend and the struggle to get her a new trial in light of what transpired during her original trials (yes - trials - Margolin really makes things interesting by subjecting the character to several different trials for the same crime, and he does a nice job of framing the struggle in legal terms).  It is obvious that the author is (or was) an attorney, which made the book all the more interesting to me.<br /><br />The only challenge I had with the book was the conclusion - it was an unexpected ending that just seemed to drop in out of nowhere & left me hanging just a bit.

111,0830839623,5,"Scholarship of the past few decades has demonstrated how productive probing the cultural context of the Greco-Roman world can be for New Testament study. Yet, it is one thing to have technical expertise in the area and quite another to communicate that knowledge in a way that engages even a beginner. Enter Ben Witherington's A WEEK IN THE LIFE OF CORINTH. I loved this book. It came to me as I was about 800 manuscript pages into a commentary I am writing on 2 Corinthians. Of course I have been living with--grappling with--the social/cultural dynamics in the Corinthian church for years and am convinced you cannot understand key aspects of the book apart from understanding those dynamics. Ben's book really put flesh on the bones of the cultural context in a way that was delightful. So, if you want to understand more about Paul's world and the cultural forces he faced in his first-century churches--or if you love historical fiction and simply want a good read for your summer vacation--buy this book!"

Please see the disclosure at the bottom of this post for more information.<br /><br />I went into this book wondering how it would enfold. It sounded intriguing and that was enough to grab my attention.  I started reading this and immediately fell in love with the characters and the writing style. Christina did a great job creating a tale that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />The novel was never dry and for the most part the dialogue flowed almost effortlessly. She did a good job of crafting her characters. Like a lot of romance, the romance came almost immediately, but personally I don't mind that.<br /><br />The novel was a compelling, entertaining, quick read that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />In Summary: A book filled with intriguing characters that was blended with wonderful writing to create a novel that left me amused from the very beginning to the very end.<br /><br />Warnings/Side-notes: This book references sex and there are sex scenes. These scenes leave slightly less to the imagination than young adult novels; however, this novel was in no means erotic or  overly graphic.<br /><br />The Wrap-up: I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are overly sensitive this might not be the book for you. However, this novel was well-written and very entertaining. If you don't mind the few references and you enjoy romance, then I would say you should enjoy this one.<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Danica Page<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I am a member of Reading Addiction Blog Tours and a copy of this book was provided to me by the author.

118,1400204127,4,"\\""The Truth about Grace\\"", is one of a series of books written by John MacArthur breaking down common areas of theology that are misunderstood and often times exploited by modern liberal churches today.  John MacArthur is a fundamentally conservative Biblically centered pastor who has written countless books, sermons, and articles teaching and leading people to a better understanding of the most elementary and basic  yet vital aspects of their faith in Christ.<br />Just like every other MacArthur book I have read he breaks down his thoughts point by point, backing everything with scripture that is always in proper context.  He does a great job of this particularly in the chapter regarding how Grace is twisted and misunderstood.<br />The one thing that I will take away from this book is an acronym that I had never heard before regarding GRACE; God's Riches At Christ's Expense.  While John explains that this is a great way to characterize grace, but theologically there is is much, much more.  His definition of grace is far more detailed and to the point.  \\""the free and benevolent influence of a holy God operating sovereignly in the lives of undeserving sinners\\"".  While I agree with this definition, it is difficult to share this definition with new believers of Christ.<br />I love John MacArthur I sometimes find him to be somewhat legalistic in his approach and theology.  This book is no exception.<br />I received this book free through booksneeze.com.  While the book was free the opinions are my own."

120,B007K4G54E,5,"If you are like me you are always looking for something positive to keep going, to keep hope alive.  In my ever widening search I came across Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide the subject of this book review.  Old lefty Joshua S. Goldstein paradigm-altering well -researched study  suggests that things are not as bleak as those on the right and left have led us to believe.<br /> This  is not a sing Kumbaya - New Age -all is unfolding as the universe intended - book.  Goldstein points out that in his opinion there is nothing particularly nonviolent in human psychology or physiology.  He also believes that there is no great nonviolent evolutionary process at work.  The progress toward a more peaceful world is demonstrably uneven and fragile.  However, his well-written book (which works as a survey course on war and peace) points out what works and how we should strengthen those things that work.  The most effective instrument of peace  is the United Nations.<br /> As I read Goldstein's narrative I was struck about how both main stream media and the right only reports peace keeping failures. If it bleeds it leads is the rule for local and international news.  Peaceful successes  don't get noticed.<br /> With almost no support from the United States, Goldstein argues that UN peace keeping  efforts -  often  eviscerated and almost always inefficient - are the main cause in the effect of a more peaceful world.<br />  His book can be heavy going.  Interspersed throughout Goldstein's book is the tragic story of rape as a weapon in war.  Sadly violence against women  is as old as war itself and rape has long been a means of destroying the social fabric of perceived enemies.  Happily, Goldstein also chronicles the powerful and increasing role of women in bringing peace to war torn regions.<br /> Two examples:  For decades, in the oil rich Niger Delta armed groups of men battled the oil companies to stop their predation.  Sick of the violence by both sides women began nonviolent protests and direct negotiation.  And in 2009 measurable progress began to be seen on the ground.<br /> In the largely nonviolent transformation of South Africa's apartheid society usually focuses on the heroic work of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.  However, research shows that in community after community it was women who made the difference in effecting reconciliation.<br /> Even if you don't buy his thesis on the United Nations Goldstein's book should be read for its many nonviolent heroes . Among them is Ralph Bunche, a life long educator and career diplomat.  Bunche was the first in his family to go to college, the first African American to earn a Phd in political science and the first African American to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in bringing an end to the first Israeli - Arab league war in 1950.<br /> Another soldier for peace is USC professor Gerald (Jerry) Bender a self described \\"" licensed lunatic\\"".  While working in Angola to bring peace Bender blew the whistle on the CIA's secret war in Angola under Reagan.  His report to congress led to the end of funding for the Agency's destabilizing operations allowing the UN peace keepers to help bring peace to Angola.<br />  Finally, there is peace's heroic martyrs: Count Bernadotte - assassinated by an Israeli fanatic in 1948 and  Dag Hammarskjöld  - who died in a fiery plane crash in Rhodesia in 1961 - to name two of the more famous martyrs for peace.<br /> I whole heartedly recommend Winning the War on War.  I downloaded the book in minutes on Kindle app for 12.99.  I also endorse Goldstein's call to fully embrace the UN - especially the blue hat from some God-forsaken poor nation under-supported, under- trained, scared out of his mind standing between warring factions.  At the minimum we should educate ourselves on the many, many people who have brought peace or attempt to bring peace often at the cost of their own lives. There a lot more out there fighting the good fight than we know."

122,2070749428,4,"Hammer...Anvil. Between a rock and a hard place. All wars can degenerate into savagery; so-called civil wars, with the double meaning in English seem to be the most savage of all. Certainly for Americans, the Civil War was by far the bloodiest, and the total dead almost exceeded all the other wars that American has fought, combined. Algeria also had a \\""civil\\"" war, after their \\""savage war of peace,\\"" their liberation struggle from the French, which resulted in their independence in 1962. In the 10 year period, 1992-2002, the \\""civil\\"" war consumed an estimated 160,000 lives. As a percent of its population, it was roughly equivalent to the deaths in the American civil war. The cause? An election. In 1991, the F.I.S. (Islamic Salvation Front) won the preliminary election round, soundly. The military stepped in to annul the results (if that sounds vaguely familiar, substitute Supreme Court for the military.) But in Algeria, it commenced a savage civil war.<br /><br />Dominique Sigaud was a reporter who specialized in the Arab and African countries. Now she is a prolific novelist, publishing a book almost annually. This book is her account of the civil war, published in 1995, by Gallimard. The title means: \\""The life, over there, like the course of a wadi.\\"" (meaning that life can be quite tranquil for long periods, but then suddenly turns violent, and overflows its banks).  She commences her account with her journey to the airport in Lyon. Leaving all that is familiar, going somewhere where very different rules apply. The change commences before one boards the plane. I've been there, in a couple different circumstances. When she arrives in Algers, she is escorted to a \\""safe location\\"" by her contact... and for reasons of security, her protectors, as well as the people she interviews, are known only by their initials.<br /><br />She obtains the government's side of the story first. Escorted to well-protected (by \\""chicanes\\"", the seemingly ubiquitous concrete barriers), well- defended elaborate security buildings, she meets with an official who jokes about the beard he still wears! And he gives her an envelope with the pictures of the atrocities committed by the FIS, the beheadings, et al. Entire villages slaughtered. She is able to obtain the other side of the story too: how the government will kidnap, torture, and kill the relatives of suspected Islamists. Mainly though, there is this vast group in the middle, between the hammer and anvil, as she repeatedly says, who are forced to join one side or the other, or pay the ultimate in consequences. She seems to identify so many of the essential elements in such a fight. I learned a new word: \\""hogra,\\"" which means humiliation, with the connotation that it occurs with official sanction. She says that all new recruits to the military go through that experience... a \\""basic training,\\"" of sorts, a \\""higher level\\"" fraternity hazing.  On the other side, she correctly depicts that so many of the religious leaders are in it only for the power, money, and yes, women!<br /><br />The book is not for the \\""fun read\\"" crowd, but it certainly conveys the essence of one more terrible event as the 20th Century closed. My problem with the book is the literally accuracy of her account. Here she is, a foreign woman, who appears not to have the essential Arabic and Berber language skills, being able to interview numerous people, on both sides of the war, alone, in French (?)  Maybe. But maybe not, and perhaps some of the book is truthful, but apocryphal.<br /><br />With 160,000 dead, a single incident is hard to single out, but I still recall reading in Lib&eacute; at the time it occurred: the seven French monks, from the Trappist monastery at Notre Dame de l'Atlas, who were kidnapped and killed in 1996. Even today, we do not know which side was responsible for their deaths.  Sigaud chooses as an epigraph for one of her chapters a quote from Father Christian de Cherg&eacute;, one of the monks who died.<br /><br />Overall, an important book on a horrible historical episode that was not well covered, particularly in the United States. Authentic, with perhaps some apocryphal parts: 4-stars.ortant book on a horrible historical episode that was not well covered, particularly in the United States.

I will say the bad guys, the Claudii, were pretty chilling, pretty much doing what they want and getting away with it.<br /><br />This story finds Falco faced with a threat to his family, and he and Petronius pretty much take matters into their own hands to take care of said threat. And I have to say that this showdown has been coming for a long, long time. The bad guys are pretty bad in this book, and in trying to mete justice, our heroes get sullied. And this weighs on them quite a bit. It affects the whole family, who in the end all agree on a grisly decision to finally rid themselves of a threat that's been haunting them for quite some years--sometimes overtly and sometimes quietly in the background.<br /><br />Several of their actions are pretty disturbing but not really that surprising when you remember all of the references Falco has made about how tough Petro is and all the rough and tumble they've been through.

132,0822938898,5,"Henry Clay Frick {HCF} is perhaps the most extreme individual representation of late 19th and early 20th century American capitalism at its zenith - ruthless, innovative, intense and relentlessly successfull. And for these very reasons he often does not play well to 21st century contemporary academics and the current liberal \\""anti - capitalist establishment\\"". H.C. Frick was a businessman playing by the rules of his era and in reading this well written and informative biography of his business career one has to be conscious of this fact and not {necessarily} to judge him by standards of 2012.<br /><br />Born in 1849 in modest circumstances at the dawn of America's industrial age he followed the pattern of C.Vanderbilt, A.Carnegie, J.D.Rockefeller and H.Ford - poor farm boys who by their ambition, vision, intelligence, an indefatigable work ethic and \\""guts\\"" built managerial and technologically advanced industrial organizations from scratch that would employ hundreds of thousands of people and would play a huge role in making the U.S.A. the premier industrial nation of the 20th century. That HCF was an unique man is beyond question and his talent and characther was apparent to his contemporaries from very early on. Certainly it was evident to Thomas Mellon of the Pittsburg based Mellon Bank {\\""a very hard man with a dollar\\""} for when Frick approached him to borrow money for expansion of the H.C. Frick Coke Company, Mr. Mellon was so impressed with the 25 year old Frick that not only did he give him the requested financing, Mellon also included an option for Frick to be be able to borrow more money as needed !! This started a lifetime association with the Mellons and HCF's closest friend would be Andrew Mellon the future U.S secretary of the treasury from 1921-1932.<br /><br />This type of banking transaction was the essence of \\""The Gentleman's Banking Code\\"" in that the intergrity and characther of an individual mattered as much if not more than his colateral to a bank extending the credit. Love or hate H.C. Frick his integrity as a businessman of a man \\""of his word\\"" and principle was something that his contemporaries appreciated and this is well represented by the author's narative.<br /><br />Frick was a millionare at 30 years old and by 1882 had caught the attention Andrew Carnegie who with his unerring scent for talent - brought Frick and his creation - the H.C.Frick Coke Company into the orbit of the fast growing juggernault of the Carnegie Steel Corporation where Frick quickly became his right hand man, the company's \\""de facto\\"" day to day manager and driving force in increasing efficency, rationization and labor cost cutting of production methods.<br /><br />The whole panorama of the Carnegie Company's and Frick's business dealing's, labor relations, cost cutting stragedies and ruthless driving for industrial efficency and profits \\""vis a vie\\"" the rest of a highly competative steel industry is well documented and detailed. The author highlights/details Carnegie Steel's postion and treatment of it's labor force and the picture presented is often a very ugly one.<br /><br />The drama of the 1892 Homestead Strike and Frick's total involvement in it from the beginning and his uncompromising stand to prevent the unionization of the Homestead Steel Works is H.C. Frick's defining moment in American History and the author tells the story fairly showing thru the company's and HCF's and Carnegie's personnal correspondence how they both were detirmined to completely crush the steelworker's union. Andrew Carnegie was a great industrialist but was not {in my opinion} a great man. The author documents his two faced hypocrisy of privately writing to Frick approving his actions in dealing with the Homestead Strike and then publically {and in private correspondence to politicians like William Gladstone} denoucing HCF and the methods he employed {all being fully endorsed by Carnegie} which show Andrew Carnegie to be nothing more than a mealy mouthed, hypocrite who would well deserve Frick's future scorn and hatred.<br /><br />HCF never regretted his actions at Homestead - he believed that what he was doing was right and necessary to preserve the company. There was something almost super-human about this man - after an attempted assasination at his Pittsburg office in 1892 {at the height of the Homestead Strike} Frick refused any narcotics for pain while he guided the surgeon to remove the bullet lodged in his neck and then without respite worked out of his home for two weeks while recovering. Fourteen days after Frick was shot and stabbed his namesake infant son died, he quietly grieved a short time and plunged right back into work. I cannot conceive of a more dedicated man of business - one has to admire his steely will but at the same time the man's work ethic is almost scary and give him an almost inhuman quality that put many people off - then and now !!<br /><br />Frick's subsequent falling out with A.Carnegie and his total defeat of him when Carnegie tried to oust him from the company and cheat Frick out of his rightfull share of Carnegie Steel is graphically detailed and again shows what a bullying, coniviving liar and cheat that Carnegie was not withstanding all of his great accomplishments.<br /><br />This is primarily a business biography so if you are interested in additional information on the H.C. Frick - the private man, I suggest two well written and lavishly illustrated books by Martha Frick Symington Sanger \\""Henry Clay Frick, an Intimate Portrait\\"" and \\""The Henry Clay Frick Houses\\"". For an excellent overview of the 19th and early 20th century American Iron and Steel Industry and its \\""movers and shakers\\"" - Paul Paskoff's \\""The Iron and Steel Industry in the 19th Century\\"" provides some additional great information.<br /><br />If you visit New York City, I urge you to visit \\""THE FRICK\\"" at One {1} East 70th Street in Manhattan - it is one of the greatest private museums in the world and the quality of what was  N.Y.C. home and the art treasures that Frick collected and are on display are simply awesome!! I received my used copy last year thru Amazon and it was of excellent quality. This is a superb book well written and researched that shows H.C.Frick, A.Carnegie, Carnegie Steel {after 1901 U.S. Steel} and American Capitalism during the \\""Gilded Age\\"" in all it's competitive fervor, technological change, relentless drive, glorious success and sordid ugliness. This is a 5 star book - Highly Recommended."

This book proved to be attention getting and thought provoking.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, but I'm also glad I'm finished.  It was very difficult for me to put it down and I got very few things done.  It first captured my attention by the style the author used.  I have read very few books that are written in first person so I had to pay attention as to which character was speaking.  It didn't take me long to be able to actually put myself into the story by the use of the style.  Second, it was very thought provoking.  There are quite a few issues brought up in the book that I knew about, but the book made me much more aware of them.  Issues such as Patriot vs. British views during the war, slavery, and faith (relationship) vs. religion were explored and developed in this story.  The part that most fascinated me was how Quakers viewed this time.  I'm not familiar with that faith so it was really interesting to see how that character went from practicing a religion to actually having faith and doing what was right in God's eyes and not just in the eyes of her church.  I would suggest reading the authors synopsis about the Quaker faith at the end of the book before reading the entire story.  It will help make the story make more sense.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that explains the Gospel message, you won't find it in this book.  Instead, you'll find characters who grow in their day to day faith with God.

138,8883701127,5,"I have used a fountain pen exclusively when writing in my Moleskine since 2006.  I have read reviews over the years saying Moleskine is not fountain pen friendly and if this is the route you want to go then you have to resign yourself to writing on just one side.  Rubbish.  I have used a Pelikan, Waterman, Shaeffer and Sailor fountain pen.  I have used a wide variety of ink's from Waterman to Noodlers and on.  I will admit here to being a bit obsessed with ink as I currently have 18 bottles of black ink on my shelf.  All of them have been tested in my Moleskine.  All of the fountain pens I use have a fine point nib.  The pen I am currently using, a Sailor Realo has an EF nib.<br /><br />I have had no issues with bleed thru making the page unusable on the opposite side.  Can I see there has been writing on the other side?  Sometimes, yes.  Does this make writing on that back page undoable?  Not in the least.  If I wanted to write on a back page and have the pristine white page the only thing I see I would perhaps look at something with Clairfontaine paper, which is excellent.  For me though, that is overkill.  Now perhaps it is the F or EF nib that I prefer to write with.  Perhaps I am more tolerant of this sort of thing than those who have posted negative reviews.  The book makes an excellent journal that can easily travel with you throughout your day.  Do yourself a favor and get one, and get a nice fountain pen to write in it with."

141,0345803485,1,"My boyfriend and I laughed while reading this out loud to each other at night in bed. The author's language style was distracting (,e.g., \\""crapola,\\""). I hardly ever read fiction--much less erotic romance--and I was excited to read this, but I have to say that this is a very poorly written book. The ending was not satisfying in the least; what did the reader learn? What was gained? What was the point? The sex scenes were drab and predictable. Grey was not appealing to me at all. The author's incessant nagging about his appearance really pointed out the superficiality of the whole book. I still fail to see how a man like Grey could have any desire for somebody like Ana...The dialogue was trite and immature most of the time. One thing I hate is cuss words during a sex scene, but that's just me. Her friend Kate had no appeal either. All in all, I really think that this book is one of the worst I've read. I only finished it because I thought there might be a good ending, but it ended as dull as it began. I will not be reading the sequels."

145,1937007448,4,"This one started out strong, with a compelling storyline/mystery. The pace slowed down a little bit after the first part of the book, but it was full of interesting revelations. Charlaine Harris mentioned a lot of old characters from previous books, and I was interested in Sookie's fantasy for the people she cared about later on in the book. I was hoping for a more spectacular use of the cluviel dor, but I guess it really is the only thing she could have done with it, especially if the books are heading in the direction I think they are. I thought this book also did a good job of keeping the vampires forefront, but involving the fae and the weres not only in the book but into the storyline as well. Charlaine Harris obviously set out to write a better book than the last one, has a lot more story to put in these last few books now that's she's wrapping it all up, and is at least going to try to make her best effort in ending the series, whether it makes all her fans happy or not."

To quote John Nash from the movie 'A Beautiful Mind,'  \\""...there is not a single innovative idea in the work...\\""  In the middle section of the book, the artist auteur's ideas on color are quite cliches.  95% of the illustrations are black and white.  The book ain't got no DVD, no extra goodies.  Free cut-out tabletop RPG cards would have been nice. The 8-page long character design template at the end of the book is thoroughly weak and redundant.  The ad on the back cover claims \\""see artwork by professional artists as examples of the techniques shown in the book.\\"". The artwork samples are unfortunately second-rate, with no commercial appeal.  I'd rather look at Picasso's napkin doodles to get true inspiration.  If you want to create something spectacular and successful like \\""The Simpsons,\\"" skip this book."

156,093607048X,3,"As a first time marathoner - just finished the Nashville Marathon - I was fully invested in the process.  I read multiple books, watched videos, listened to running experts, bought all the products necessary, and learned as much as possible to make my attempt a success.  So when I heard about the Galloway method, and subsequently received this book, I was very interested.<br /><br />What I found within the pages of this book was a mixed bag.  A 1:30:00 hour split at the half marathon and a 5 hour finish.  Within the pages is a smorgasbord of useful tips on how/when to run, when to walk, how to improve, where to set goals, how to train, and a variety of tips and tidbits that most running novices don't know.  I learned quite a bit.  Having said that, I could have used more, and the presentation could have been more linear and concise.<br /><br />Regarding the linear thought, there is far too much bouncing around in this book.  All too often the book is self-referential when a topic has not been covered.  A reader is forced to jump ahead several pages or chapters to learn the tactic or topic at hand, then go back to the original location and continue on.  This is quite frustrating, particularly because Galloway is known as an expert in training us mere mortals attempting to finish a marathon.  As for being concise, there is a bunch of repetition throughout the book, and there is literally an entire chapter copy-pasted from one page to another.  Maybe an editor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />The final thought I have on this book as it relates to Galloway's run-walk-run method is the dire necessity of an extra chapter titled: Running Etiquette.  The team-building aspects of his method are great, and the physical benefits are without question, but the rolling roadblocks that occur as a result of the above combination are incredibly frustrating and inconsiderate.  A solo run-walk-run practitioner should be to the side - particularly if they have headphones in when they shouldn't - but is fairly easy to avoid.  A group, however, running and then suddenly stopping for their walk break is a recipe for disaster.  I experienced this numerous times during my marathon and knew the exact source.  The lesson of the chapter should be: Get out of the way.<br /><br />Overall I was a bit disappointed.  I will definitely apply some of the lessons learned, particularly the training methods and dietary recommendations, but overall there are better, more thorough, more concise sources of information.they shouldn't - but is fairly easy to avoid.

157,1596987960,5,"In Marked for Death, Islam's War Against the West and Me, Geert Wilders has written a compelling and essential cri de coeur explaining and exposing the great Islamic Jihad that threatens the existence of the civilized (Western) world, as we know it.  Wilders is most qualified to do this because he has an all-too-vivid grasp of the insidious power of this scourge. And he has given up his freedom and potentially his life to expose and resist.  Wilders is a Dutch politician who had to accept the protection of the state because his opinions about the threat of Islam had offended Islamic barbarians who threatened to kill him for his words. After a Jihadist slaughtered eccentric film maker Theo Van Gogh in the streets because he made a movie that he perceived as insulting, Wilders had to go underground and accept a restricted life under the enhanced security.<br /><br />Almost worse than the danger Wilders faces from primitive Jihadists are the attacks he has withstood from the political Left and Right both in Europe and America.  He has had to defend himself in Dutch court against \\""hate speech\\"" charges at great expense to avoid prison.  He has been denied entry to the UK to show his documentary \\""Fitna\\"" in spite of having been invited members of the House of Lords. His death has been called for a prominent Dutch Police Chief and he has (shamefully) been called names and dismissed by conservative pundits such as Charles Krauthammer who called him a \\""demagogue.\\""  All because Wilders is part of that very small number of Western figures willing to truthfully define Islam and its spread as a mortal threat to the West.<br /><br />Luckily for us, he would not be intimidated or silenced by the threats and  name-calling and since then has continued to live his life to tell the truth about the threat to our freedom.  As Wilders puts it in this book, \\""There is no better metaphor to illustrate the difference between Western values and the \\""true faith of Islam\\"" than the difference between a pen and an axe.  We settle our arguments with the former: Islam uses the latter.  It is a frightening metaphor in some ways, indicated that when are attacked with axes, we have only pens with which to defend ourselves.\\""<br /><br /> The book is a triumph of organization and command of the vast destructive force masquerading as a religion, which has evolved and unfortunately influenced, cowed and conquered vast swaths of the world (ever wonder why there are over a billion Muslims?).<br /><br />In 217 immensely readable, yet information-packed and documented pages, he manages to tell his personal story and survey the history of expansionist Islam, its impact to date, explain the philosophy and methods of its brilliantly evil founder, expose its fundamental tenets and techniques for conquest, identify key historical and current players in this struggle (heroes, villains and cowards). He also presents much information that all but the most academic historians might know.<br /><br />The details are what make this book so fascinating, although the fascination is sometime reminiscent of the hypnotic force emanating from a cobra's eyes.<br /><br />For example did you know that:<br /><br />* Hitler and the Nazis were enamored with Islam<br /><br />* Historical and literary figures from Churchill and Jefferson to Andre Malraux and Aldous Huxley warned against the dangers of Islamic conquest of the West<br /><br />* 60-80 million Indians died as a result of Jihad<br /><br />* The bulk of African slaves were sent to the Islamic world<br /><br />* Turkey's current Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared \\""the mosques are our barracks...\\""<br /><br />* Opera houses in Europe have stopped performing Mozart's Idomeno for fear of inciting Muslim violence because Mohammed figures in the story<br /><br />The bottom line is that no matter what you think you know about this most vital subject, you've got to read this book. The key to Wilders and what makes him almost unique isthat he is cultivated, civilized, a classical liberal yet absolutely fearless in his ability, willingness and devotion to telling it like it is.  You will not read that the terrorists have \\""hijacked a great religion\\"" or any other PC drivel which has been forced on us by our leaders: from George Bush to Barak Obama.<br /><br />This book is an unblinking and brilliantly realized, meticulously documented, survey of 14 centuries of Islamic expansion with a prescription for beating the back the tide.  But like all strong medicine it will be hard for our degenerated society to take.<br /><br />Luckily for the rest of us, there are some people willing to throw their bodies literally and figuratively on the live Islamic grenades that are being rolled into our most vulnerable and precious vaults of freedom.  And Wilders is one of them for which we should be thankful.that he is cultivated, civilized, a classical liberal yet absolutely fearless in his ability, willingness and devotion to telling it like it is.

The couple focus is on Brigham Langston and Serena MacGregor on the eve of the Jacobite uprising of 1745.<br /><br />My Take<br />Well, it was a rather mediocre romance with the usual suspects. I'm hoping its purpose was simply to provide a reason for the family's exile and striving to return to their lost estates.<br /><br />If you've read a few histories and romances about the Jacobite Rebellion, the '45, you know how it goes.

Bonnie Prince Charlie intends to take back his crown. It's why Brigham and Coll are riding fast for Coll's home in the Highlands. But it's Brigham's Englishness that warrants his violent reception when he arrives with a dying Coll.<br /><br />Nothing will soften Serena's perception of this Englishman. Nothing but those impatient kisses and fevered caresses.<br />And in between, the MacGregors and Langston are rallying the clans--with a slip for Coll to rediscover Margaret MacDonald's more grownup beauty.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Ian and Fiona MacGregor are the Lord and Lady of the manor whose daughter, Serena, has good reason to despise the English. Coll is her older brother followed by Gwen and then Malcolm the younger son.<br /><br />Brigham Langston, fourth earl of Ashburn, has been filled with tales of the Scottish kings on his mother's side of the family.

Let's remember that this is a love story and perfectly captures the incredible highs and lows of a first love.  One minute you are unbelievably happy, the next you feel so low.  A young first love (well I know they are both not that young but they are both very immature) can be all consuming, couples often neglecting friendships, work, family etc.  The downside of this book, quite frankly the endless repetition of phrases, Are there too many sex scenes?? Well at first I quite enjoyed them but after the first book, it was a case of \\""here we go again\\"" so I  began skipping them, they bored me, and made me want to scream every time she said \\""holy cow\\""!  And for a man with so much money and so many clothes, why does he wear the same grey pants, hanging off his hips, so annoying.  And he is so immature, I wanted to hit him with his ever changing moods (oh yes his mercurial moods, again this was repeated over and over) and his childish<br />jealousy, I just wanted Ana to grow up and stick up for herself but all this simpering \\""Oh my poor damaged Christian I will never leave you\\"", crap really bugged me. But then again, this is true to life, it happens so often , a girl becomes besotted with a guy and starts to lose herself, taking on the identity of her man, and putting up with so much crap in the name of love.  well they do say love is blind.

She has traveled the world, photographing the anguish of humanity in turmoil.<br />The novel opens as Xandra and her father go back to Viet Nam to spread the ashes of her mother.  She has taken with her the old film camera her father used all those years ago.  Back in New York, she begins to develop the film.  As each print of the Viet Nam landscape emerges, she sees momentary images.  Death.<br />She is stunned, overwhelmed by what she is sure her father saw and photographed.

170,1400078857,3,"Overall, this book was very dry and something I would expect to read if I was to study Sparta at a Masters or PHD level. I would not recommend this book to anybody. Instead I would probably just point somebody in the direction of the movie 300, or the history Channel's, \\""Rise and Fall of Spartans\\"". There are far too many alternative and interesting resources for somebody to research about the Spartans for waste time on this novel. Perhaps this book just isn't for somebody of my generation or social interests. Even though I practically warship Spartan values, philosophy, and discipline level, I feel that this book lacks in the intensity somebody like myself might expect and it seemed more like a college text book if Spartan history was a specific class. Furthermore, this book had absolutely zero impact on me because despite the fact that I was able to learn multiple interesting facts, I would rather have retrieved them from a more exciting publication. However, considering Paul Cartledge's extensive background as a scholar, I would say that this may be among his best books. It is clear that he knows what he is talking about and does not seem like the type who would write an action packed scholastic novel on Sparta. It is a good book, it is very informative and it is chalk full of facts and unknown points."

174,0307268845,5,"This is a gorgeously written, moving novel.  The characters are complete and nuanced, and Freudenberger deftly avoids falling into stereotypes or cliches.  Most of the reviews focus on the later scenes in Bangladesh, which contain beautiful, often dreamy details while maintaining the pace set at the outset of the novel, but I thought that the earlier scenes in Rochester were even more masterful, and reflected at least four different, equally real, accounts of what it means to be and become an American.  I highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about contemporary fiction---I've been working my way through the Booker Prize shortlist lately and I think the Newlyweds surpasses each of those novels in terms of the quality of the writing, completeness of the characters, and general storytelling ability."
175,0230621236,5,"\\""Castro's Secrets\\"" is the book of the year! Latell skillfully unravels the many secrets that existed in CIA's Cuba program and Cuban intelligence. The fascinating information unearthed by Latell is often shocking - as he makes the case that Fidel Castro knew of Oswald's Kennedy assassination plans before hand. Fidel's assassination teams are described in detail, as is Fidel's penchant for revenge, deception, and intelligence & counterintelligence operations.<br />Latell's extensively documented book is incredibly well-researched and leaves readers with few (if any) questions about the veracity of his claims. Throughout the book, it becomes clear why the first-hand sources used by the author are indeed reliable.<br />Ultimately, it is a book that will fascinate anyone interested in Cuba, CIA, the Kennedy assassination, or intelligence in general."

181,1849701490,4,"At long last comes the highly anticipated conclusion to Aaron Dembski-Bowden's Night Lords trilogy, Void Stalker. Considered to be one of the best new authors of the Black Library by many a fan, Dembski-Bowden exploded onto the with Cadian Blood, an Imperial Guard novel featuring everyone's favorite citizen soldiers duking it out with plague zombies. Since then Dembski-Bowden has only refined his craft with The First Heretic, a notable edition to the Horus Heresy series. Nothing has displayed the depths of his skill, however, quite like the Night Lords trilogy. Void Stalker brings that arc to a satisfying completion.<br /><br />Talos and the remnants of his warband have been fighting a losing battle. Casualties have cost the Night Lords greatly. Seeking answers Talos orders the return to Tsagualsa, second home of the Legion. There Talos may finally found a way to strike a meaningful blow against the cursed Imperium in the Long War. Unknowingly, the predators have become the prey. The alien Eldar are in pursuit with a most important mission: the Prophet of the Night Lords must die.<br /><br />If you haven't first read Soul Hunter and Blood Reaver you will most likely be totally lost. In this case, go buy the first two books of the trilogy and take a few days off work. If you have have been following the series, welcome back to First Claw! The best thing about Aaron Dembski-Bowden has got to be his ability to write characters. Talos and the members of First Claw are all surprisingly human, reflecting the qualities of their birth race but at an amplified degree. I never would have expected this from the murderous monsters that sided with Horus during the Heresy but it makes sense. The traitor Legions all fell from the Emperor's light due to their baser emotions and those qualities are reflected in the ranks of First Claw.<br /><br />Talos, Soul Hunter, the Prophet of the Eight Legion is one of the most interesting characters you will find in 40K fiction by leaps and bounds. Talos is now in charge of the Echo of Damnation and the remaining Night Lords of 10th and 11th companies. Funny to say but in a lot of ways Talos is a romantic idealist. He desires a return to the founding principles of the Legion, before it was saturated with murderers and rapists. Talos seeks a chance to strike a meaningful blow in the Long War rather than just survive and hide.<br /><br />The other characters are no less fascinating. From Xarl the Company Champion to Uzas whose brain is clouded with worship for the Blood God and Variel the Flayer, First Claw is a colorful and dysfunctional team to say the least. To give the story human perspective are the slaves Septimus and Octavia, two unlikely lovers who have developed a rather serious problem of their own to deal with. I commend Dembski-Bowden for killing off some major characters this time around. I won't ruin the read with spoilers but some of these beloved cowards do perish.<br /><br />The plot makes for a good conclusion to the trilogy, taking an exciting twist with the return to Tsagualsa, the very place where the Night Lords' Primarch died and the Legion was broken. It's great to see Talos decide to stop running and fight a real fight. Granted, even when backed into a corner the Night Lords find a way to fight on their own terms and what a marvelous battle it is. Void Stalker may just be Dembski-Bowden's most action packed story to date, but it's really the character depth that carries the novel.<br /><br />I only had two problems of any real note with Void Stalker. One would be the lack of characterization of the enemy Eldar. For someone who writes villains so well I sort of expect more depth from the primary antagonists. My other problem was the finale which just felt rushed. The three epilogues lessen the blow somewhat, but after following First Claw for three books now I hoped for more of a climactic ending.<br /><br />Minor gripes aside, fans of the Night Lords Trilogy will not be disappointed with Void Stalker, and any 40K fan that has not yet read this series needs to immediately. Aaron Dembski-Bowden has distinguished himself as a great author and a huge asset to the Black Library. I can't wait to get my hands on his next novel, The Emperor's Gift (a Grey Knights novel) out at the end of May.<br /><br />*The magical Goatfairy grants Void Stalker by Aaron Dembski-Bowden, 8 out of 10 cheesewands*<br /><br />Nick Sharps<br />Goatfairy Review Blogd with Void Stalker, and any 40K fan that has not yet read this series needs to immediately.

182,0143112392,5,"I discovered Ferguson, a Scots historian now at Harvard, when a friend introduced me to his last book, \\""Civilization: The West and the Rest,\\"" which I previously recommended. That led me to search out other works by him, and I expect to read more after this one. Ferguson is a fine writer with the ability to capture the essential quote or detail to illuminate his point. He was going to write a WWII book, but decided that had been done. Instead, he looked at the violence of the 20th century, not only wars, but genocide, pogroms and man-made famines like Stalin's that killed millions to bring ethnic areas like the Ukraine to heel, viewing it as one long, world-wide war. It is hard to say I liked this book, because it is hard to like such an extensive catalog of man's inhumanity, but I appreciated the way he drew the themes together, discussing the causes of the violence in the bloodiest century in history. It remains to be seen if our current century will be better, but certainly a thorough understanding on what happened in the last one is necessary if there is to be a change. This book is a great place to start.<br /><br />Robert A. Hall<br />Author: The Coming Collapse of the American Republic<br />(All royalties go to a charity to help wounded veterans)"
183,1468053841,5,"I am thoroughly enjoying \\""The Magic of Art for Therapy\\"" and I highly recommend this book as a real tool for anyone who wants to learn to make beautiful art--while working on themselves and their inner healing. This book, with beautiful color images throughout it, would make a great gift for a family member or friend who needs guidance and inspiration to begin the journey of an inner search for self-acceptance and stress-reduction through the process of art-making and visualization. It would be a particularly nice book for someone who has been ill, recovering from an illness and wishes to use art as a medical intervention to help them restore good health. Annette shares her personal journey in this book of a long-term illness and how she used art as a process to de-stress and heal. She shares methods for self-exploration that are very accessible and useful for anyone interested in improving their self-awareness and well-being. I plan to use this book with a family member, my mother, who is elderly and we will go through the processes together. It would also make a wonderful book for a caregiver and patient to use together.<br /><br />The book takes the reader by the hand and introduces the process of making art as a deep healing experience. Even if you have never been engaged in much art making in your life, this book will show you exactly how to go about using art for healing. Also, Annette uses a color-coding technique throughout the book that makes it particularly easy to follow and to use.<br /><br />While this book is professionally written and well informed in psychology, it is presented in a style that the general population will understand and enjoy. I love how Annette has woven theory and experience to put together this simply delightful, unique one-of-a-kind book.  My favorite sections in the book are the gems of wisdom in the Visualization sections.<br /><br />written by Martha Love, MA, PMA<br />author of [[ASIN:1466429895 What's Behind Your Belly Button?: A Psychological Perspective of the Intelligence of Human Nature and Gut Instinct]]: A Psychological Perspective of the Intelligence of Human Nature and Gut Instinct]]"

190,0316069868,3,"This book was heavily marketed as something new and interesting that you had to have for Passover.  It was way overhyped.  It was sold as having an improved English translation, interesting commentary, inspiring images, and an approach that aided you in remembering that you were a slave in Egypt.  It accomplished 0.0 of those things.<br /><br />The translation is not better than what I've seen out there.<br />The added commentary is sort of night school philosophy 101 style. I enjoyed it, but that's more of a strike against me.<br />The imagery is just not that inspiring.  It's different Hebrew fonts throughout history.  The idea is that Jews have been around long enough to develop different fonts.  It's cute.<br />It is `traditionally' sexist, as others have pointed out, but beyond that it promised to be moving, poetic, and relatable to the 21st century American and it just plain wasn't.  The English text was sort of discombobulated.  I must be doing it wrong, but when you read it straight through it does not form a coherent whole, it just sounds like a bunch of prayers strung together.  Sometimes the same prayer said in a different way.  That's what made me mad enough to write this review.  When you heard Foer talking about it, he made it sound like he was revising the Haggadah as a sort of play, where we at the dinner table would all become actors who experienced what it was like to live in Egypt.  That idea really spoke to me, because Passover as a kid was when I learned about Jewish history, and making us at the table a part of it sounded like an amazing experience that I wanted to try.  I just didn't get that reading the book."

192,0062024043,5,"There is always some apprehension when you pick up a sequel to a book that you love. Will it be as good as the first or will it be that awkward sequel that just doesn't live up to the first and really only serves to set up the last book in the trilogy? I am very happy to tell you that Insurgent fits into the first category. In fact, not only was it as good as Divergent, it was better!<br /><br />Insurgent picks up right where Divergent left off. I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil anything but Tris and Four have to deal with the chaos that begins at the end of Divergent plus Tris has to deal with her actions during those events. One of the things I loved about this book is that Tris struggles to deal with the repercussions of her actions. She doesn't always deal with them in the best way but that's how things are in real life. Tris reminded me of friends that I know that are suffering from PTSD. That being said, I still found myself being frustrated with both Tris and Four through out this book. Things are a mess in every faction and as Tris and Four try to figure out what comes next and who to trust they make things an even bigger mess.<br /><br />Even though I was frustrated I still loved every minute of this story. There are moments that made me swoon (Four *sigh*), moments that made me really angry, moments of betrayal and moments that made me cry. If you thought Divergent was non-stop action you were sadly mistaken. Divergent was just one of the kiddie rides. Insurgent is a grown up ride- so sit down, strap yourself in and keep your hands inside the ride at all times!"

Which I believe that Dean Koontz is too.  At least where his books are concerned. I do love that he included a dog, as he does in many of his books, which I also love.

The hardback version of the current edition has paper that is thin enough to see the illustration on the next page. That's annoying. The reproductions of the drawings in earlier editions were of good quality and large enough to easily appreciate the differences pre and post-instruction. The reproductions in this edition are muddy-looking compared those in earlier editions. In the earlier versions, there were many examples of pre and post-instruction drawings, especially by kids. Those are all gone. Perhaps someone thought the date of their composition was too old to include them in this \\""newer\\"" edition. That was a BIG mistake. The pre and post-instruction portraits in this edition are confined to tiny examples on two pages and are badly reproduced. It also looks as though the talent of her students has markedly decreased over the years since the previous editions. This is a big disappointment. I'm sorry I ordered this rather than the earlier one for my young friend. Now I'll have to send him the earlier version and an apology as well. Anyway, Betty Edwards, sue your publisher.

202,1604738308,1,"After posting my review several months ago, I see that more recent entries have lavished praise on this book, but BUYERS BEWARE. No one who has actually read this book could truthfully make some of the statements which are contained in these 5-star reviews. Because this book bears no resemblance to way it is being described by others -- as possessing such in-depth research and objectivity, such thoroughness and fresh insight. BALONEY. The word \\""masterpiece\\"" does not apply here. It is a literary DISASTER. Repeatedly the author relies on Don Pierce's accounts, at a time when Mr. Pierce was of advanced age. And as I stated previously, Pierce was notorious around town for being a master bullsh---er. The legitimacy of this book is undermined when, in his introduction, Nate Gibson says that Mr. Pierce told him what to do and comments, \\""I DID WHAT I WAS TOLD.\\"" If you don't believe me, look up the quote. What an embarrassing admission for an author to make! He says Don told him this, and Don told him that, and he recites this all without applying any critical faculties to WHAT Don told him and the truthfulness thereof.<br /><br />The editorial description is promising but the book is a serious disappointment. The fact that the author collaborated with Starday owner Don Pierce means that we get a picture of Mr. Pierce that is as if peering through rose-colored glasses.<br /><br />Ray Baker, a long-time and very respected record producer and member of the Nashville music fraternity, recently gave an interview in which he dismissed Nate Gibson's book as a fantasy, and described what Don Pierce was REALLY like, based on his dealings with him. Mr. Baker has an impeccable reputation around town and tells it like it is. He says Mr. Gibson's book misses the truth by a country mile.<br /><br />As Ray Baker describes it, Pierce made duplicate tapes during sessions and then bootlegged unauthorized copies. His studio was very poorly designed, with terrible acoustics. and his engineering staff was even worse. Much of the product that was produced there had too-thick reverb, or other audio imperfections, thanks to Mr. Pierce deputizing the late Tommy Hill to set things up. Tommy -- who had ZERO knowledge of sound or electronics. Don recorded anybody and everybody who came through the door and his approach to marketing product was to throw as much mud at the wall as he could, so some of it would stick.<br /><br />Nate Gibson has obviously allowed himself to be swayed by Mr. Pierce and has not achieved any objectivity about the events and history. Now if it was Don Pierce's name on the book, with Mr. Gibson's in small print below, we could accept this as a self-serving autobiography by Pierce. But the book purports to be fair-minded and historically accurate account of Starday's history by Mr. Gibson, and it so obviously is NOT.<br /><br />It is also significant that while supposedly writing a thorough history of Starday, the author fails to talk about the biggest hit ever recorded there: Jim Reeves \\""Distant Drums.\\"" He never even mentions it! This had only been a demo, penned by Cindy Walker, that Reeves had cut as a favor to her when his producer, Chet Atkins, turned down the song. After Reeves died in a plane crash, the song was overdubbed and released as a single. The story behind this monster hit (which even went #1 on the British charts where it stayed for 5 weeks at a time when the Beatles were so popular), SHOULD have been in Mr. Gibson's book. How could he have overlooked this? This omission alone is so significant it speaks volumes about the author's poor research. (To read the definitive account of this, see the new book, [[ASIN:0615524303 Jim Reeves: His Untold Story]] sold on Amazon).<br /><br />So many of the stories in \\""The Starday Story\\"" are incomplete. For instance, the author says of Dottie West that \\""West paired up with Chet Atkins as producer in 1964\\"" without explaining HOW this came about. (It was Jim Reeves, who first met Dottieat Starday, and who convinced Chet to sign her to an RCA contract without her even having to audition).<br /><br />And as for all these families that were interviewed, once again the author does not apply any analysis to what they told him. He just dumps it all in the book without sorting truth from fiction. The reader deserves more than this.<br /><br />Yes, the author has records listed in the back of the book but this should not convince even the casual reader that he knows what he's talking about. This may impart the gloss of thorough research, but as one who has been around Nashville for quite awhile, I know \\""the rest of the story\\"" to a lot of the anecdotes in the book, and I can tell you the author only scratched the surface. He didn't dig deeper.<br /><br />I was also very disappointed by the lack of good pictures in the book. I would have thought that an enterprising author would have managed to dig up a lot more rare photos but Mr. Gibson did not. The pictures in his book are few in number and very poor in quality. There isn't a single photo in the book that gives an overall view of the Starday studio! Amazing! We aren't told much about the equipment, either. Where are the studio logs? Not to be found here.<br /><br />This is by no stretch of the imagination a book adequate to cover the subject. It is an amateurish effort with clumsy writing that is cringe-inducing, and huge, huge gaps in research. A BIG THUMBS DOWN on this one!"

Part 2 made me so happy because I was expecting to relive so much of what I loved about part 1 all over again. I start off in part 2 thinking it started slow, but I knew Tracy Brown had some twists coming. I became disappointed when I came to the end and nothing else was said about anybody but Sunny, I know the book was geared toward her but still, I was more interested in Born and Jada honestly. I know Tracy wrote this book this way for a reason, she probably was thinking we would all understand this means part 3 will be a pure master piece, but as long as we waited for part 2 we wanted more than we got. But I told myself to not worry about it, part 3 is gonna be so good it will make up for it, Tracy may even spin White Lines and Snapped all together since part 2 kept having appearances from Gillian, Dominique, and spoke of Frankie as well. If she spins both story lines into a great big twist I know it will be a book I will never forget. I will be so happy just to finally know Born and Jada can finally be happy. I don't want Jada to get caught up in Sunny's nonsense either. I'm glad Born stepped up and put his foot down this time, he knows whats best for her and they need to be able to live happily ever after even though life doesn't work that way."

Marshal tells a story about individuals and small groups of men who braved steel and lead to accomplish their mission:  clear the way for the exit of troops from Utah Beach on D-Day 1944.  The foreward by Carl Sanders states that he recommended the book to young men who wondered what combat would be like.  In many ways, Sanders was correct.  Much of the book reads like the opening scenes to \\""Saving Private Ryan\\"" over and over again.  There is very little glory but a lot of blood, injury and death.  In the end, the American paratroopers prevailed at great personal cost and sacrifice.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a story about paratroopers, D-Day 1944 or small unit infantry combat.  Once you start, it is difficult to put the book down.  I have read it countless times.  There is no problem with the book itself, only those who read it.  It is a \\""story\\"" loosely based upon facts taken from interviews of many individuals.  If you are looking for a detailed history based upon good investigative techniques and verifiable facts taken from many perspectives, this book is not for you.  If you are looking for a great work of historical fiction which tells a story from the point of view of American paratroopers in June 1944, then look no further.  If you are a former paratrooper and avid paratrooper junkie like I am, \\""Night Drop\\"" will not disappoint you."

208,0967089735,1,"This book really is a good read. It contains lots of nutritional advice, and techniques for incorporating fermented whole foods in the diet. IF you have time to experiment with this, it is definitely useful. But it is a book of philosophy and belief, not always of proven fact. It would be a top shelf book except for two very serious flaws:<br /><br />1  The advocacy of dangerous levels of fat in the diet. Yes some fats and oils show some benefits. But it is faulty logic to extrapolate that to say that a diet high in fat and cholesterol is good for you. The American diet really is terrible in its use of sugar, salt, bleached flour and fat. This book contributes with high fat and salt.<br />2  Scientific misrepresentation on a grand scale. One would expect beliefs to be modified by science, but Sally modifies science to suit her beliefs. An example of an outdated science error: laboratory scientists once though seafood contained high cholesterol.  They then discovered that this was a laboratory mistake and seafood is low cholesterol. But even in the second edition, this mistake persists in the book, and the fallacy is used to argue that high cholesterol is not harmful. The most outlandish error: That it is okay to feed ground up sheep to cows and that this does not cause mad cow disease. The most serious error: Science has not shown a high fat diet to cause arterial blockages. This is a book that can kill people through the mail box if they take it too seriously!<br />Nutritional science does have a confusing history, and it requires humility and expertise to balance out the information. This book lacks these qualities, and unfortunately when reading the book there is no way of knowing what is true and what is not. Weston Price was at the cutting edge of science in his day, and I think he would be sorry to see this book ossify in its advice rather than to be properly updated according to the best science available.<br /><br />Yet another complication which I regret having to raise. Pickled and fermented foods cause cancer of the stomach and oesophagus. There are ways of reducing this risk. All of this should be discussed in the book; but it isn't. When we buy a book, we are paying for the author to have researched the subject thoroughly and to pre-digest some of the information for us.

209,1442432780,5,"Like so many people have agreed, the cover is hot, And I don't disagree with that! But the story is intriguing too, one that grips you from the first page to the end,<br /><br />Whym Island is a tiny island off the south coast of South Carolina that may as well be a tourist trap, especially with their \\""Whym Island: Some Things Must Be Seen to Be Believed\\"" tagline. And that's a philosophy that's especially scoffed at by year-rounders, the ones who have boats and know the tides like the back of their hands. Which is why no one on tiny Whym Island 100% believes that it was an accident that 17-year-old Miranda drove her boat into a shipwreck that killed four of her friends.<br /><br />Losing four friends is insurmountable enough, but Miranda, an orphan raised by her grandmother, alternates between feeling like she got the worst luck in the life-lottery drawing and just feeling numb, She knows it was an accident. She knows it was an accident ... and yet ...<br /><br />Getting into Miranda's head, the reader learns about the mysterious boy who rescued her from the water, who is both everything she feared and wished for. Deftly weaving dialogue with setting with heart, the author weaves an enchanted--and doomed--world you'll be only too into exploring. Highly recommended for teen paranormal fantasy fans!"

213,B000OKEEZ8,5,"This big book was first serialized between 1855 and 1857. I can imagine people waiting for the next installment and talking with their friends about the story and their hopes for what the characters will do next. I know when I was young we used to talk about TV shows in this way, too. Do people still do that? For me, the talking with others about stories is a great thing. Everyone is better off for having done it.<br /><br />\\""Little Dorrit\\"" is described as a social satire and it does have wonderfully biting things to say about society, about government (the \\""circumlocution office\\"") and petty bureaucrats, and it even has a kind of Bernie Madoff scandal in it that any reader who lived through that scandal can relate to easily. But, for me, there is a lot more art to this work than just its very funny humor and more than half-crazy plot.<br /><br />I know that this novel gets a lot of criticism. But I really loved reading it. People complain about its convoluted plot, and I guess if that is what I was reading it for I would have to admit that the plot, especially at the end, seems forced and more complicated than it needed to be. A bit self-indulgent. But I don't think the story itself is the point of the book. As I read this book I was floored by the beauty of several scenes that will remain with me always. Little Dorrit's \\""Party\\"". Clenham's facing his maturity and placing the roses in the river and watching them float away with his youth. The scene where Amy's father has asked Clenham if he might go for a walk outside the walls and Arthur replies that he cannot, but it will only be a few more hours. And Mr. Dorrit replies, \\""A few hours, sir,\\"" he returned with a sudden passion. \\""You talk very easily of hours, sir! How long do you suppose, sir, that an hour is to a man who is choking for want of air?\\"" The true power of that line is revealed solely because we have spent so much time with the man and the mask he has worn for decades in the Marshalsea. He has worn it not to deceive anyone, for who could be deceived, but to survive there. And to see it taken off just then is stunning. And, for me, the greatest scene in the book is towards the end when the other prisoners comment on the nobility of Amy versus the assumed nobility of \\""society\\"". There are many other wonderful scenes, but these are just a few of my most favorite.<br /><br />As I read the book I came to see it as a story about character. Dickens uses the plot to put the people of the story in very different circumstances and their character is revealed to us by how they act in those circumstances. And, for me, this was the truly important aspect of the book. Frankly, the book enriched me. And this is the kind of art I love best. Not to pass the time. Not to distract me. But to allow me to feel that my life is richer and has more substance because I experienced this art. I don't really care that the plot has certain implausible aspects to it. I care deeply that I got to watch these people demonstrate who they truly are because they believed in the reality of the story and acted sincerely within it.<br /><br />I think these illustrations also add a lot to the story. Of course, I had to use a magnifying glass to fully enjoy them, but I wasn't in a hurry to get through this work. And also found it wonderfully enjoyable to look up words about clothes and carriages and activities of the time I did not know. And the way Dickens uses English is marvelous. I found myself looking up the etymology of some words to just dig into the richness of how Dickens was using words that I found less familiar or the usage seemed different to me. Of course, Dickens is one of the writers from whom the rules are made so we should get used to him and reorder our own thinking about our language with his striking richness of words.<br /><br />I hope you take the time to read this novel. Not only is it far superior to most of what is written today. It remains far superior to much of what has been written at any time.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MIten at any time.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Saline, MI"

He knew all the letters by sight and the sounds they made (short vowels only) & had mentioned one day he wanted to learn to read, which prompted my purchase. We took the first book out of the first set and he read the whole book in under 5 minutes without help. It is such as confidence builder for them to be able to read an entire book! The whole first book uses the letters M, A, T, & S (and the word 'on')and gets them familiar with those sounds before introducing other letters in each book. He finished the first set in about a week and is now working thru set 4. The sets progress nicely, adding longer words, blending sounds, more sentences per page so that the kids don't feel like it's above their level; just make sure they are fluent with one book before moving on to the next, as concepts build on each other. I cannot say enough good things about these books. As the mother of 3 & a former day-care provider, I recommend these books to everyone!"
217,1416940898,5,"Reading Dairy of a South Beach party girl, I felt like I was really in South Beach.  The author did South Beach justice in her descriptions of the architecture and vibe of the place.  She made me want to live in South Beach! The main character was relatable, in that we all felt at one point that we played it safe, and wished we could live a more fabulous life.  The author does a great job proving the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  The main character's ups and downs showed that no matter where your life leads you, your exactly where you want to be and taught us not to judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book, it read light, like a beach read, but had a lot of substance."

The author does a superb job of giving you a glimpse into the mind of a serial killer as he takes you along on the quest to capture him.

The hero, Paul Chang, is very well defined and we are treated to a deep understanding of his personal history and his struggles with his own violent nature. Further, there is a broad exploration of the political side of police work and the inherent struggles that aspect brings.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoy mysteries or shows such as \\""Criminal Minds\\"" then I am fairly sure you would enjoy this novel as well. Excellent plot lines, and plenty of action."
219,0985337206,4,"Pros: (1) As a Spanish teacher who is very interested in the way people learn (learning styles), I was thrilled to receive my Rojo card set and see that there were pictures! The pictures are easy to recognize (at least the non-verbs) so you know what the English word is! The other side shows both the English and Spanish, so you can read the English again to associate it with the Spanish. You would have to look at the words for the verbs at least once, to read what the picture represented, but once you do, they should be easy to remember.<br /><br />(2)Besides the use of pictures,  I really liked the phonetic spelling on each card, for example cama (bed) is also shown KAH-mah, so you know how to pronounce the word. (3) Lastly,  I liked the size of the cards; they could be easily hole-punched and put on a ring for review.<br /><br />Con: I would've preferred to get a set of flashcards that were related by topic, rather than what seemed like a random assortment of words.<br /><br />I look forward to trying the flashcard games on Señora Gose's website!"
220,1428165169,4,"Not an easy book to love. The main character, 71-year-old Nathan Zuckerman, seems to be losing his marbles. Prostate cancer has left him impotent. He's incontinent, wears a nappy, sometimes he smells of urine. Yet none of this prevents him spending half his time lusting after a woman in her twenties. And when Zuckerman begins imagining how he might talk his way into her knickers there's no denying things at times can get a little grim and creepy. That said, as always, it's impossible not to admire Roth's flawless prose and searing honesty. He writes brilliantly - and brutally - about ageing, death and loneliness. There's some good stuff, too, on writing and writers. With every sentence you know you're in the company of a master, albeit one whose best years are gone and who knows the end is near."
221,0061962767,3,"This review is also posted at The Bawdy Book Blog.<br /><br />Thumped is more of the same satirical drama we had in Bumped, but taken to the next level. And yet I found myself liking it a little bit more. Who knows? Maybe the characters grew on me.<br /><br />Thumped picks up exactly 35 weeks after Bumped left off: Melody and Harmony are thirty-five weeks pregnant with Jondoe's twins and Lib has used them to create the MiNet sensation, The Hotties. They are no longer individuals; they are a brand and society is in love with them. Except they have one small (big) problem...<br /><br />I can't say that I initially enjoyed Bumped, because it was so over-the-top and in-your-face. I found the premise a strange sort of ridiculous and somewhat shocking (but on the flip side, some good books have great shock value, right?). So I was apprehensive when I was given Thumped for review. Thumped is much the same, but McCafferty takes it to the next level. Where I was a little lost in her messages with Bumped (for the record, I wrote that review after I had read Thumped), I sort of got what she was implying with all the satire in Thumped. We could become this if we stay too connected and let bogus media influence our lives. Hell, maybe we're already there with all of the internet sites, rag mags and, yes, even Twitter.<br /><br />I get why she chose the subject of teen pregnancy; it is quite the shock-fest. Where books like Wither show the decay of society into polygamy, Thumped shows the ascension to abusing the Next Generation (no, that isn't a salute to you Trekkies....sorry). It really made me think: how far would we go to preserve the human race? How far would YOU go to ensure the survival of your family line? I think I would go pretty far, but I don't know how far. So Thumped became thought-provoking for me.<br /><br />So that begs the question: why didn't I like it more? Well, I'll tell you, the slang sort of ruins moments in the book for me. It's hard to keep up with it, without a glossary and who wants to refer back to a glossary all the freaking time? I don't. (And it's honestly not impossible to keep up with, but it felt like I was reading a strange version of English...which I was.) Often the characters annoyed the crap out of me. Harmony was less \\""churchy\\"" which is great, but not because I'm anti-religion or anything; I really felt like in the first book, McCafferty took the church thing too far with Harmony. Yes, there are extremists in every group, but the point of this novel was to amplify everything and Harmony's church-ways seemed overly amplified in my humble opinion. This is coming to you from someone who doesn't even attend church, except when I have to go to a funeral. Or wedding. So the dampening of Harmony in Thumped was very welcome. Melody wasn't as interesting in Thumped as she was in Bumped. I found that she often took a backseat to Harmony's escapades, even though she presented as the stronger character in Bumped. Where was the strong, egomaniacal Jondoe that I sort of liked in Bumped? Instead we have this emo kid lusting after someone he hasn't seen in thirty-five weeks. Le sigh. Probably the coolest character was still Xander, for being anti-let's-use-teenagers-to-reproduce and expressing his thoughts concisely and consistently. I also liked Lib. Just because he was so outrageous. Sometimes outrageous is great!<br /><br />Overall, the sexual themes and content continue in Thumped, although any real heat happens off page. I still wouldn't find this series suitable for young teenagers. While there is no gratuitous sex and McCafferty's message rang loud and clear to me, I think the satire is too mature for young audiences to conceive (pun intended).<br /><br />**I received this ARC from the publisher for review.**ithout a glossary and who wants to refer back to a glossary all the freaking time?

222,1613771487,3,"US comic strip fans have been waiting a long time for a collection of \\""The Little King.\\"" It's finally here and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />The editors did a nice job of cleaning up the strips that have been out of print in the US for a long time. I'm not sure why the first quarter of the book is in color and the rest of it is in black and white. I prefer the black and white because it is easier to see Soglow's rigid and mathematical lines. Each of the hundreds of strips has a lot of build up before the final \\""shocking\\"" gag panel and they are all generally cute with a few that are poignant. It is very difficult to read a whole slew of strips in one sitting. The temptation is to read past most of the panels and go straight to the gag, because many of the strips fit into a couple of different formulas that Soglow mastered.<br /><br />The introduction includes many interesting examples of Soglow's work before \\""The Little King\\"" as well as numerous examples of his advertising art, but I take issue with the introduction's thesis that \\""The Little King\\"" represents a struggle between Soglow's inner-leftist and his desire to make money. That seemed like the unsupported thesis of an academic (who probably knows a lot more than I do about the material). Soglow obviously reveled in marketing his character for the sake of money. I also disagree that the strip is artistically economic and that there are no unnecessary lines, because Soglow draws plenty of unnecessary (but visually delightful) panels in every strip.<br /><br />I would have liked an explanation of why they chose the strips that are included. There are huge chunks left out. I'm curious why. I know there is some racist imagery in some of the strips (that is not as disgusting as the awful stuff in \\""The Little King\\"" animated movies), so that could have been an issue. It also might be the case that the strips not included just weren't that funny. I would have liked a discussion of that.<br /><br />All in all, thisis a valuable book because until now, it has been very difficult to find \\""The Little King\\"" in print."

I am re-reading it now and taking points from the book that can be taught to my 4th, 5th and 7th grade classes.  I will also be teaching directly from the book with my high school sophomores.  For the little ones you need to first explain the biblical points.  That takes a while to teach, but once you work that out these kids will want to hear more and more.  I cannot stress how valuable this book is for every Catholic who truly wishes to embrace and learn more about their faith."

According to chpwn, a big name in the iOS hacking community, the book is wonderful and does, indeed, have information on jailbreaking. Indeed, a quick look at the sample content on this very website shows that there's an entire chapter dedicated to this very concept.<br /><br />So, yes; an uninformed 1 star review, countered by an (only slightly) more informed 5-star review. Any chance of some reviews by people who've read it soon? :D"
233,0982167075,5,"The story of Fahim Fazli reflects the love and passion for what true believers of the tribe call the American dream.  The hopes and dreams of all who wish for freedom and the chance to be something greater than the whole yet proud to protect the whole on those principles of God, Corp and Country.  It speaks of sacred thoughts and cherished hopes of all great citizens who believe in the freedom of man and the opportunity to challenge those who would take said freedoms and the desire to protect those who wish to always have those freedoms.  This is a book well worth reading which revitalizes the true spirit on which this country, the United States of Amercia, was founded.  Written by a man whose birthplace and adopted country are different yet all in both crave these values.  Thank you for your service to your country and your most enjoyable book- Semper Fi, Gunny."

235,1741798523,4,"****1/2 (4.5 stars)<br />Venice is a unique city, in beauty and history; one time it was the capital of the Venetian republic, and its protector is Saint Mark, shared with Alexandria, Egypt. Its university was and still is in nearby Padua, where two of my graduate professors once invited me to see its first anatomy theatre. I visited Venice many times, as a graduate student, as a project manager with little time at hand, with my family in the 1980's, and while on consulting jobs in Vicenza.<br /><br />This brief opening meant to insinuate that two strong points in this Lonely Planet guide are the pristine beautiful photos, and the tours and red entries: Grand Canal, Venice in Art. Top Sights come in blue, and are cool; San Marco, Palazzo Ducale, Lido, Murano are the famous ones together with the Ponte (bridge) Realto, these are what I have shown my family, three decades ago.

236,1594202958,5,"I've read many of the reviews here, and I have a very personal opinion to add.<br /><br />I agree with 1 reviewer that the leader's cited in this book weren't 'mad', and so the title is off.  It's speaking about 'border-line' personalities; people suffering from depression, manic-depression and hyperness (in layman's terms).<br /><br />I myself suffer from depression and ADHD-inattentive type.  This Dr's account brought me much comfort.  I have often wondered why I can understand things so clearly that I can't convince others to be true.  Or how I'll be the only one in the room who can so quickly and clearly see the heart of the concern.  I've found that I'm very good at advocating for these types of children in the public school system.  In meetings, no one can cut-to-the-chase the way I can.  So many times, these kids need just a little tweak or different approach by their well-meaning teachers to thrive.  I have seen this many times.  And once the teacher's been educated for the one child's betterment, then they're a much stronger teacher for the other similar personalities they have to deal with through the years.  These kids are very high-risk for jail, drugs, or self-harming.  But if handled correctly, they offer an amazing amount of potential for our world.<br /><br />I have also often wondered why our greatest leaders so often seem to have so many issues with infidelity; and have been concerned at our modern trend towards discounting leaders who are unfaithful to their partners.  We wouldn't have had FDR, Kennedy, Dr. King, Jr., or countless others if we had traditionally held their personal lives accountable.  I was surprised that this Dr. didn't write about Dr. King's marital indiscretions as part of his diagnosis (too politically uncomfortable)? This book explains why these types of personalities; who are so amazing at their jobs, may have personal  struggles in their daily lives that aren't always easily understood.<br /><br />Lot's of the reviewers heredidn't get some of the Dr's theories.  For instance, he never said that Hitler was 'fine' before he became over-medicated (or a nice person).  What he said was that Hitler became insane and ineffective once he was improperly medicated. Hitler was a very effective, albeit evil,  leader. His personal ideologies have to be taken in the context of the time period and the country from which he came.  He wasn't alone in believing what he believed or in doing what he did.  Many countries, including a lot of England, agreed with him.  What the Dr. was discussing was how effective his illness made him, in what ways, and how he changed once he was improperly medicated.<br /><br />One reviewer refutes that Abraham Lincoln suffered from a deep depression, which is generally considered to be an accepted fact.  The reviewer's who say that the Dr. doesn't understand personality disorders are clearly making ineffective arguments, as he is one of the best at what he does.  However, I do understand the controversy, as he is breaking new ground here.  I did think that the Dr. leaned heavily towards Democrats in his view of great leaders.  I agreed with him, but could see that Republicans could discount his theories and arguments on the ground that they didn't think his examples were great, or even good.  I wonder how many of the examples cited suffered from ADHD; the Dr. didn't discuss this at all.<br /><br />People with non-obvious disabilities are not treated well in our society and are under-appreciated and misunderstood, even by themselves. It's hard to be different and to live daily 'against-the-flow'.  This alone can cause depression, as Society batters anyone who's different, starting in elementary school.  I've often wondered how much some depressions are a 'chicken or the egg' type dilemma. I'd like this Dr. to take this one step further, is the patient depressed because they're empathic (being bombarded all the time with other's emotions is difficult) or are they empathic because they're depressed?  This Dr. goes along with current thoughts that the depression comes first. What this Dr. does show in an amazing way is just how much these personality types have to offer our world and how valuable they are.  They may be the one's to save us all."

240,0345803485,5,"First of all, I would like to state that everyone is entitled to their opinions, hence why I am taking the time to leave my own. However, I feel that the attack on this book is a little harsh and some of the reviews I want to scream at. Do I agree that this was not the best written book ever? yes. However, keep in mind that author's write to an audience of people. A book that readers can relate to and I feel that this book did it. As far as the feminist outcry over this book, I hate to ask it ladies, but really? Are you blind to the fact that Annastasia Steele is a very strong female character exploring her own sexuality and consents to everything that Mr. Grey wants to try. Her strength as a character changes Mr. Grey into something he never thought he would be or their relationship into something he has never had. Also, for those who say it is badly written, what more does the story need? Ana communicates with her readers through her inner dialogue and talks as any college graduate would. E L James connection with music and classic literature shows her appreciation for the arts. Christian Grey is a very complex character who was dealt a bad hand of cards and depends on a woman (without acknowledging it)to fight his demons. There is clever word play, humor, eroticism, love, and sympathy and the author does a good job at hitting all these emotions. It left me wanting more and now I am on the second book of the series. As far as the lack of communication during sex, think about how limited your vocabulary is when you are having sex. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to explore the realm of erotic fiction. It is very enticing and will make you wonder why!"

242,1619493152,3,"How far the mighty fall.<br /><br />Paine refuses to condemn even the most hideous atrocities of the French Revolution, and indeed, imagines that other countries should applaud and emulate them.  As if \\""FREEDOM\\"" meant \\""freedom to live in terror of the Paris mob,\\"" or indeed, \\""freedom to participate in the random, vicious slaughter of innocents ALONGSIDE the Paris mob.\\""  But in this book, there is no such thing as an \\""innocent\\"" aristocrat.  The aristocracy concept itself is oppressive, and must be rooted out through violence in pursuit of a \\""pure\\"" France of poverty, random dismemberment, starvation, and despair.<br /><br />In this book, Paine considers ALL the authority of the past illegitimate -- all of it.  All structures from family to piety to duty to honor must fall ... supposedly because it is \\""enlightened\\"" to think so.  Paine thinks the only thing holding people back from becoming truly transcendant beings (heaven on earth again) is those moldy old conventions.  If this sounds like Pol Pot and Mao and today's \\""pragmatic\\"" politicians, it's because revolutionaries from that age to this have borrowed these words in pursuit of their true goal: POWER.  They've also borrowed the methods of the French Revolution -- terrorizing their own people and destroying their own nations.<br /><br />SO, my big question is this: Is it because of Paine that Jefferson failed to comprehend the evil of the French Revolution?<br /><br />How could Paine, who championed the American Revolution (a war to UPHOLD the long-standing British principles of natural rights and common laws, which were being violated by the Colonial governors) have written this book so soon on the heels?  Was Paine secretly paid by the National Assembly to produce this?  Did he instead revel in misery and bloodshed, was he a real sicko? One must wonder.<br /><br />The person to read on the French Revolution is Governeur Morris, the American minister to France after Jefferson's stint there -- his journals reflect the reality on the ground, and he roundly conveys his disgust.

It deals with how we see ourselves as gendered selves, and the various quizzes within give you the opportunity to question why you chose your gender and how you can step outside of it if you choose to. The book really is just trying to get you to see what's staring you in the face.  Because only when you've seen this can you truly say that you've chosen to be who you are. It's a book of liberation from yourself. Don't be put off by her/his smart ass attitude.  She's chosen to be that way. More than can be said for most of us."

It does an amazing job of presenting a completely foreign legal system in a way that is accessible to American students.  The authors demonstrate their very nuanced understanding of the developments in EU caselaw.  They also carefully describe the ways in which it continues to evolve, which makes me more optimistic that my knowledge of European law will not be outdated in a few years.  I also particularly liked the analogies that were drawn to US jurisprudence -- it really helped me to put the division of powers in perspective with the  material that I have learned in con law and federal courts."

251,0375863419,5,"Wow. I just finished Split, and I'm having the hardest time organizing my thoughts. I am completely overwhelmed and in awe of this book. It's too amazing to put in words.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't love Split from the start. I can't even remember why, but I wasn't immediately sucked in by the story - maybe it's just because I've been super busy with school and it took me a while to read the novel. But, in a way, I like that I took my time with Split - it grew on me, and it made me fall in love with the story slowly - even while I wasn't reading, I found myself thinking about it constantly.<br /><br />The idea for Split is great. I've read a few books dealing with domestic violence and abusive relationships, but Split is different, since it's about what happens after you make the choice to leave. I really liked that this book offers a new perspective, as it shows how deep the issue really is - even though Jace got out, he is still very much shaped by his father's abuse. I don't want to tell you too much about Jace's secret because of spoilers, but it's heartbreaking to see how hard his life is because of his dad, how it influences every relationship he'll ever have.<br /><br />For the most part, the plot is fast-paced and thrilling. Split is a real page-turner - especially in the second half, I didn't want to put the book down; I needed to know what happens to these characters.<br /><br />The writing is incredibly vivid - I felt like I was right there alongside Jace throughout the story, and I could imagine every situation perfectly. It makes the story even more real, raw, and heartbreaking.<br /><br />Jace is an amazing character. I didn't always like him, but that's kind of the point - he's not supposed to be perfect; he's supposed to be real. And he is definitely real. There were times when I wanted to shake him, but really, I couldn't blame him for the way he acts. His thoughts are so complex and offer a whole new perspective on abuse, the long-term effects I'd never even thought about. Jace's voice is so real, I feel like I've known him forever.<br /><br />Christian is a fascinating character, too. The relationship between him and Jace is one of the things I liked best about Split - the ups and downs are perfectly done. I would love to see what it's been like for him - his decision to leave the family, how he dealt with knowing Jace and their mom were left behind, how he built a life for himself, and what it's like for him when, years later, his younger brother shows up at his door. I would love to read another version of Split, written from his point of view.<br /><br />I also loved Mirriam. She added a unique way of seeing things, and I love how she kept trying to get Jace and Christian to open up. Reading the story from her perspective would be interesting, too. Really, if it were up to me, Swati Avasthi would spend the rest of her life writing new versions of Split, from each character's point of view, and I would read every version.<br /><br />The ending is perfect. Somehow, it broke my heart and put it back together again, at the same time. I wanted the happily-ever-after for each character, but it's just not realistic, so I'm glad the author went with this ending - the perfect tie between heartbreaking and hopeful.<br /><br />There are so many more amazing things about Split that I can't even put in words. It's dark, raw, powerful and disturbing, in a good way, and it offers unique insight into the lives of abuse victims. Read it - you won't be disappointed."
252,1413748260,5,Great read and filled with suspence and realism that kept me trying to figure out who the locals really were. I found myself in the book and feeling the fear and intrigue of all the surounding elements involved. I'd pass this book around but I may never get it back.
253,0141180145,5,"This is one of those novels through which an apparently simple narrative unfolds to expose a singularly wonderful piece of satirical literature. I had approached the purchase of the book rather obliquley, having read Solzhenitsyn and perusing online other Russian authors. Having come across Bulgakov, this book came highly recommended as his 'masterpiece', and after finding out what the theme matter is I decided to puchase it.<br /><br />The novel deals with the Devil, and how he and his retinue deal with the established soviet literary and state-atheistic powers during Bulgakov's contemporary 1920s/30s Russia, whilst at the same skilfully interweaving the story of Pontius Pilate and Christ's crucifixion. Throughout this narrative, a poet (Ivan Homeless), an unnamed writer (the Master) and Magarita weave their own stories, which combine at the end when the fates of Pontius Pilate and the Master are decided together.<br /><br />I found it a wonderful and thought-provoking read, skilfully translated from its native Russian. Thoroughly recommended."
254,1400078458,4,"This is quite an interesting book that \\""explores\\"" the life of this extraordinary man, Percy Harrison Fawcett.  I must admit that I had never heard of him in my life (and I have been around more than a few years).  The pure tenacity and perservance of this man goes a long way to explain his ability to survive in such a hostile environment (at least, for non-natives in the Amazon).  I recommend this book which I read on my Kindle Touch. I would have given it a full five stars, but I was disappointed that the findings of modern day anthropologists (& others) were limited to the last few pages of the book; these modern findings are a revelation and (in fact) justify many of Colonel Fawcett's beliefs in an ancient, extensive and sophisticated Amazon civilization that did not survive contact with Europeans searching for El Dorado."
255,0763654035,1,"This YA sci-fi novel tells the story of Tucker, a teenage boy who, in an attempt to rescue his parents, travels through time and space via futuristic diskos. In his journeys, he travels to the future and the past as he tries to follow his parents' footsteps and discover their fate.<br /><br />This book started with a lot of buildup. Time and again, the chapter ended in what I expected to be a major turning point, but turned out only to be a continuation of the same building action. When the story finally did pick up, I found the narration frustrating. Everyone seemed to know what was going on except Tucker (and therefore except the reader). Scenes were painstakingly described, and only later did Tucker (and the reader) find out that they were actually somewhere familiar -- the top of the World Trade Center towers, for instance. As Tucker hopped from diskos to diskos, the scenes all skipped quickly by without Tucker (or the reader) really understanding where he was or what was going on. At the time it all seemed kind of pointless, as the story didn't really progress beyond telling us that he visited a bunch of different places. From plodding to pointless, the story finally moved into the end, which was simply bizarre and pretty much sacrilegious.<br /><br />Perhaps others may find more redeeming qualities in this story, or perhaps information revealed in the rest of the series would cause this one to make more sense, but I don't plan on reading more to try to find out."
256,1567420222,2,"I wanted more of an African American songbook. The book is very small and the songs are only numbered with no titles. They categorize the songs but I would have to look online to find the name of the individual songs. There is no sheet music, just a thing at the top which says what tune it goes to, such as; Olivet, Stella, St. Peter, etc. which won't help you if you don't already know how they go. The songs are very old fashioned with thees and thous, maybe I was hoping for more modern Southern Baptist, this reminds me of a Catholic hymn book. Some of the songs are still pretty though, just not what I was looking for."

Was everything that she said exactly true, only she can say; only she can know?  Do I think that she blatantly lied for sensationalism, no I don't.  I do think that she was maybe gullible in the fact that she believed her husband's account of the murdered boy.  I think that anyone of us remembering back into our youth may have memories that stick better with us than some, do to their sensationalism.  I think this is her story and she chose to tell it how she did.  Should we chastise her for this?  I don't think so.  Do I wish she delved more into her divorce and custody issues, yes I do.

262,0547567375,3,"There were many aspects of Jacqueline Davies' \\""The Bell Bandit\\"" that I liked.  Siblings Jessie and Evan Treski are caring, intelligent children.  They are hard-working, helpful, and empathize with others.  Jessie is accepting of her grandmother's young neighbor, Maxwell, and his friendship with her grandmother.  Davies does an outstanding job of capturing the children's personalities and their reactions to various situations.<br /><br />The references in \\""The Bell Bandit\\"" to the vintage television series \\""Get Smart\\"" are a fun tip of the hat to adults who may be reading this book to someone or may be having the book read to them.  Davies does a good job of developing the story and of tying the various elements together for a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The story touches on several areas needing further development as each may be encountered by a child through contact with someone in their own life.  It becomes evident fairly quickly that the elder Mrs. Teski is suffering from some type of Alzheimers-like problem.  She has nearly burned down her home because she forgot about a tea kettle heating on her stove; she does not recognize her grandchildren; and she seems to become confused easily.  A simple explanation to Evan and Jessie by their mother about the elder Mrs. Teski's memory loss would have been appropriate.  Maxwell seems to be an \\""outcast;\\"" later explanation by his mother to Jessie hints at his potentially having Aspergers.  This would have been an excellent opportunity to foster greater understanding of both conditions.<br /><br />There is one scenario, however, that should have been omitted since \\""The Bell Bandit\\"" is geared toward the 9 to 12 year age group.  In the course of their search for the missing bell, Jessie and Maxwell discover Jeff and Mike Sinclair, budding sociopaths, torturing a frog.  The details of the process for the torture are set forth in chapter 11, along with a diagram of the torture device.  This could be extremely disturbing to some young readers.  It is gratuitous, unnecessary, and unrelated to the overall storyline of the novel.

263,1451648537,5,"So what can I add to this discussion of one of the most well-loved people of our time?  Well I suppose the thing that I keep coming back to is not the life Steve Jobs lived, but more the lessons he learned.  I have come back to this book over and over again to re-read sections on how he learned from his mistakes - even though he may have been reluctant to admit them.<br /><br />Steve Jobs was in many ways the polar opposite of myself.  So I take from this book ways of re-thinking my current position in my company and career.  In this regard, Walter Isaacson has written a book for the ages.  Steve's attention to detail, while maintaining a larger picture.  The ways he would start at 'no' and work to 'yes'.  The ways he would always push for what he thought was right regardless of the opposition.  I hope I can learn from and apply some of these lessons in my career.<br /><br />Overall - I highly recommend this book.  It should be added as a 'must read' to all college management courses."
264,1564148785,4,"Druidry, as a philosophy and a faith, seems to be aching to find a middle-ground between the history we long for and cannot have, and the modern day connections we need to survive.  Dr. Myers performs this balancing act admirably in this introduction into the faith, providing the historical background (from the little definitive information available) for each topic, and then proceeding into how it can apply to one's life in later sections and chapters.  His knowledge is evident: he discusses the historical role of the Morrigan, how the druid fits into his community, and myriad topics that are important for beginning on the path of the Druid.<br /><br />Beyond the knowledge, Dr. Myers brings something else to the page: emotion.  The book is peppered with personal experience, and his passion is seen on each page if one is willing to merely see it.<br /><br />Why, if I give it all this praise, did I deduct the fifth star?  First, I occasionally had issue with the organization of the book.  While the chapters seem to work well together as a whole, the book seems to start in an odd place.  Once it hits its stride, around chapter 3, the work flows much more smoothly.  Second, I don't give anything but the most extraordinary works of literature that fifth star."

Sometimes Bumped was so far over the line, I had to remind myself it was satire. I originally tried to read this book and I was so disgusted, I put it down and only after receiving the sequel, did I pick it back up. If I reminded myself that it was a satire every now and again, it wasn't as hard to get through and I was able to enjoy the ridiculousness of it a little better. So it wasn't all bad, I guess.<br /><br />Bumped follows the stories of reunited identical twins Harmony and Melody in a post-Virus world where teens get paid to \\""bump,\\"" errr, impregnate themselves for profit to help America further the population. I guess humping is the patriotic thing to do. And there are two ways to bump: get signed by a rep, thus going Pro, or bumping with your boyfriend or at an orgy party and becoming an Am. Each method guarantees you money when you sell your baby, but the difference is, how much?<br />Bumped definitely gets an A for being original content. I don't think any other author has been brave enough to attempt such a hot button topic as teen pregnancy and promiscuity, and attach profit along with it. But I got the feeling that there wasn't a lot of the author's heart and soul in Bumped and it was written to only shock readers. There was no underlying message to take away from all the underage sex that happened off the page (I'm the furthest thing from prudish, but...holy crap!).<br /><br />I noticed the jabs at our \\""connectedness\\"" with references to the MiNet. Everyone is connected in Bumped, everyone is in everyone else's feeds, people trend like topics trend on twitter and in general, you are just always online. I did feel like this was great satire, since another hot button topic today is how connected we all are. This made me very aware how far we can carry it on the internet and how much further we could potentially take it.<br /><br />There is a lot of slang in Bumped, but after reading for a bit, it wasn't that hard to follow. I just found most of it ridiculous. I rilly don't have much more to say about it other than that, I guess.<br /><br />The characters in Bumped were...also ridiculous. I'm not sure I really liked any of them except for maybe Zen, when he wasn't trying to hump things. He had a lot of good thoughts on the veritable community brainwashing society had done to these girls to get them to want to birth babies at ages as tender as 12 and 13 - and have multiple pregnancies for more money! Melody and Harmony were sort of interesting, but I felt as though the author tried too hard to make them exact opposites, Melody having been raised in Otherside and Harmony raised in God-fearing Goodside. The author made Harmony so outrageous in regards to her religion that I think it actually came off rather malicious. Other characters were, in fact, more vapid and self-serving, although I did enjoy Lib, because while he was so over the top, he encompassed all the traits of a sneaky representative I would imagine. I did like Jondoe, because of why he was doing what he was doing.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't exactly like the novel, but I didn't loathe it enough to terminate (LOL, JK! I don't loathe any books enough to do that!). The shock factor was, however, intriguing enough to want to read the second book. Would I recommend this? Only if you enjoy YA and satire, but be prepared. This is not a book for young teens or tender hearts.<br /><br />For the sake of WTF, I feel like I need to include a glossary with this review:<br />Pro - Professional procreator<br />Am - Amateur procreator<br />Bump - Have sex<br />Rilly - Really<br />Terminate - Just Die<br /><br />So if you've read it, what did you think?

270,0465031331,1,"This book is supposed to be about the disfunction of the American system. But in reality its an attack on the republican party, a call for a return to the \\""good old days\\"" of Rockefeller Republicans and the political/intellectual/social marginalization of a large part of the American electorate.<br /><br />The book is ironically another manifestation of the very politics it claims to oppose. In making its case in one-sided partisan terms, it defeats its own argument. If the problem in the American political system is really down to republicans and those who vote for them, the author's problems are not with the insitutions of the country but rather with the idea of a democratic political system itself. If the large number of voters who elected the republican majority in the house are to be considered evil, insane or so stupid that they can't be trusted with the vote, democracy is simply not going to work.<br /><br />The book doesn't even try to be balanced. The Republicans are \\""extreme\\"". They don't support the inherited institutions created by the Great Society and the New Deal. They will not compromise. And ultimately the reader is told that to disagree with the Democratic political agenda is to be an enemy of fact, evidence and science. Thats not measured. Thats not useful. That is the language of a polemic.<br /><br />We are told that good democrats like former speaker Jim Wright were heroic figures abused by republicans. Wright's ethics problems we are told deserved no more than a repremand. And the democrats losing control of congress in 1994 is just an utter disaster for the country. You would think, reading the book that the overheated politics of the 1970s and the partisan divisions which broke out within the congress and the country never happened.<br /><br />They offer three big ideas for reform:<br /><br />(1) Create higher voter turnout. The idea being that non-confirmists can be marginalized through a larger electorate which will favor democrats.<br />(2)Create open primaries so that the voters of one party can control the candidates nominated by the other party. Again, the intent is to marginalize anyone who does not support the status quo. Introduce preference systems of voting and runoffs so that blocks of voters have a means of *preventing* those candidates they don't like from being elected.<br />(3) Restrict fundraising. This will essentially freeze incumbants in office and make challenges to them unlikely to ever work. The authors like the idea of politicians being less accountable to voters in general.<br /><br />What about term limits? We are told term limits, like balanced budgets are stupid. In general, any idea not sanctioned by the democratic party establishment is stupid as per the book.<br /><br />We are told by the authors that the republican party is irresponsible. But what to the authors would a responsible republican party have looked like? On p. 187, for example, we are told that the republicans should have supported the Obama economic plan in its entirety (and stopped talking about that supply side nonsense), supported carbon taxes, supported the Obama health care bill and supported Obama's energy policy. But rather than supporting every item in the Obama legislative agenda, the author tells us that these evil republicans \\""opposed, obstructed and tried to nullify\\"" the policies of President Obama. The author seems not to understand either democracy or a two-party political system.<br /><br />In terms of media, they talk about creating a \\""new public square\\"" through giving billions to NPR and PBS to be collected from broadcasters. They need billions because they want the official \\""moderate\\"" position media to have enough money to crush commerical rivals including cable and talk radio. They would also use these enormous sums of money to fill the web and social media with appropriate political ideas and acceptable candidates.<br /><br />They also call for Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Apple to usetheir power to strangle voices on the internet spreading what are considered bad ideas (p. 181). Its sad that they don't even blink when talking about using the power of large corportions in what amounts to a campaign of censorship in favor of one set of political beliefs.<br /><br />And they want the political and cultural elite (he gives Oprah and Bill Clinton as examples) to start collectively using their power to attack dissent and bad ideas. They talk of reintroducing \\""shame\\"" into the public space as a way of dealing with conservatives who say or do the wrong thing.<br /><br />In summary, this book is not objective, even handed or much of anything other than a reactionary call for restoring the \\""good old days\\"" when democrats held power as a matter of the natural order, incumbants were as entrenched in office as they were often unaccountable to voters and where three television networks would tell everyone what they were supposed to think while keeping the wrong sort off the air entirely.<br /><br />The authors of this book don't like democracy or the first amendment for that matter. They prefer the clubby politics of a rich elite that decide things for people. Conservatives or people who dissent from the New Deal/Great Society views of the Democratic party are to be left on the outside looking in.<br /><br />Its important to note that some of us lived through an era where things in washington worked almost exactly the way they described them. And that the result was Lyndon Johnson sending hundreds of thousands of what were his slaves off to die in Vietnam for the greater glory of America. If we retroactively apply their ideas to that era, to have opposed the Vietnam War would have been to oppose facts, reason and science. The Johnson administration had no end of government reports saying how necessary and good the war was. Even if the republicans are the great evil the authors paint them as, that would still not be a reason to bring back the system of the bad old days."
271,1463791216,5,"This story is so personal to me.  I grew up in the same era, attended the same high school and knew many of the same people.  And coming from the perspective of an African American, I concur with many of the challenges of that time. I don't know how we all survived it.  Although Joe's perspective was humorous, much of it was not. Along with the racial tension, being a teenager catapulted into that environment under duress was tough. I'm thankful for his sense of humor which got him through.  Also, I thank him for sharing his story so candidly.  Looking forward to his next book."
272,0062082353,4,"This is the best SEAL book I've read in awhile, and I've read quite a few.  It will especially appeal to those with an interest in special operations and snipers.  In the book, former SEAL Chris Kyle writes of his experiences as a SEAL sniper in Iraq, eventually becoming the most lethal sniper in US military history.  The story is told well, in a way that you'd expect a SEAL would tell of his background and experiences.  It also has a fair amount of attitude and opinion--which I liked--but some may not.  Basically, when you've been there and done what the author has done, attitude comes with the territory.  In the end, the book is not all about the author, but also pays tribute to his teammates, some of whom were killed or wounded in action.  This is an outstanding book for many reasons--one bonus is the story of how the author knocked out \\""Scruff Face,\\"" aka Jesse Ventura--who absolutely deserved what he got."
273,0849948320,5,"I requested Billy Graham's \\""Nearing Home\\"" book in November of 2011.  I have deeply admired Dr. Graham, his ministry, divine wisdom, and love for his Lord and Savior.  I have always believed him to be our modern-day prophet.  In this day, there are few that can even come close to that title.  He has always held himself to the Lord's standards, and not only preached it, but lived his life as an example for the Lord.  Even with all my deep respect, love and admiration for this man that I have never met personally, it was with a little hesitation that I requested this book.  And thus, put off reading it until just recently, April of 2012.  Really, my hesitation was purely selfish - not wanting to face the inevitable fact that Billy Graham was nearing leaving this sinful world to live eternity with his Lord and Savior.  The thought of Billy Graham not on this earth to \\""be our lifeline, our connection to God\\"" was a bit scary to me.  Yes, it sounds like I am glorifying Billy Graham, rather than his Maker.  But truly, that's probably how the Israelites felt after Moses died - not really worshipping the man, but respecting the man whom God used so mightily.  So, with that said, realizing I must lean on the Lord, I finally picked up \\""Nearing Home\\"" late April of 2012, with a box of Kleenex's nearby, just in case my little heart became soft.<br /><br />Right off the bat I was hit with my own purpose, calling and demise in my life.  What have I done for the Lord?  Have I lived my life for Him?  Have I followed in His calling for my life?  Will He say \\""Well done\\"" when my days on earth are done?  These are questions we will all have to answer for.  For me, there certainly are days that I am not proud of.  Dr. Graham encourages us to \\""not retire from life\\"", but until our dying breath, God has a reason for keeping us here.  What a statement of hope that is!  We are commanded to care for others; \\""feed my sheep\\"" were the words Jesus spoke to Peter before He ascended into Heaven.  Dr.Graham wisely states, \\""even if on our death bed, or an invalid, fill your mind with the knowledge of the Lord, as you impact those around you with hope\\"".<br /><br />The love that is in the pages of this book totally shattered my hesitation, and actually encouraged and lifted my eyes upward.  Not only does Dr. Graham give practical advice to those who are in their elderly years, but he also gives wisdom to those who are younger:  to plan for the future, to think about your actions today that may affect your tomorrows, to practice forgiveness (\\""one of the most beautiful words in the human vocabulary\\"" - I love that!), to build our lives on Christ.  Then, by the time we are elderly, our roots will have developed and strengthened, knowing that our present is not our future.  What wisdom.<br /><br />In conclusion, I loved the last paragraph that Dr. Graham used in the introduction of his book:<br />\\""Someday our life's journey will be over.  In a sense, we all are nearing home.  As we do so, I pray that you and I may not only learn what it means to grow older but, with God's help, also learn to grow older with grace and find the guidance needed to finish well\\"".<br /><br />Amen.  Thank you, Dr. Graham for your words about \\""Life, Faith and Finishing Well\\""."

My ego judged...and for eons I missed out. Today, having only once read, and now have oodles of notes and underlines (Kindle reading), I have found, apparently it is so: when the student is ready, the teacher appears.<br /><br />In this text, Emmet Fox takes a very deep look at the words reported to be Jesus' sermon in the various New Testament books, particularly Matthew. For me, he deciphers in a way that some may think blasphemous... such as God being IN each of us, and that indeed we are not as separate as some religions teach. He suggests heaven is not 'up there'...it is here on earth. He believes and teaches if we have the faith as demonstrated by the 'man' Jesus, we too can do miracles...<br /><br />And there's much to gain...and I sense, like reading any 'ancient' text...or even the teachings of Gandhi or Mother Theresa or Deepak Chopra or Pema Chodren or The Course in Miracles...it's the kind of book that grows and teaches as we're ready.<br /><br />I hope you dare to try it...especially if you're not a believer in religion. It's really mind blowing if you're mind is open to it.<br /><br />:) Susan"

I've been a serious collector of cup plates and other pieces of early Boston & Sandwich pressed glass for about 25 years. Don't worry. I'm not going to tell you the convoluted story of how it all happened.<br />  This book is amazing and is filled with scholarly information and research as well as B&W photos of every known cup plate pattern and variant manufactured by the company. They (Lee & Rose) also assign catalog numbers to the plates and arrange them into groups which greatly eases the task of identification, etc. The catalog numbers were long ago adopted as the collecting norm. The pages are on glossy paper and the bindings are heavy duty and seem to last forever. They remind me of \\""library edition\\"" books which are all around better constructed.

As for the criminals, Bill Kirton will have you laughing out loud with his over-the-top characterisation and his perfectly-polished, acerbic prose. I particularly liked the doctor in the hospital who had prescribed the wrong medicine and, in a state of panic, anxiously checked the patient to make sure his condition wasn't career threatening.<br />Humour abounds as Bill takes us on a rollicking, roller-coaster ride through the demi-monde of Aberdeen and Inverness. Bill's book probably isn't going to be on the shelves of the North of Scotland tourist board, but he does a marvellous job in keeping us entertained while at the same time having a hefty dig at the vagaries of the offshore oil industry.

Two things I'm not crazy about: the spelling of \\""Bizzy\\"" Bear (why not just spell it \\""Busy?\\"" but I guess adults will be the ones reading it, so it's not too big of a deal) and the text--the text makes me cuckoo because it's so dull!

284,0547807686,4,"Oliver Potzsch burst on the scene with his enjoyable debut, \\""The Hangman's Daughter,\\"" a tale of intrigue and murder set in the small Bavarian village of Schongau.  While the story was more about the hangman, Jakob Kuisl, than his titular daughter, \\""THD\\"" was sufficiently full of thrills and historical details that you didn't care too much.<br /><br />With \\""The Dark Monk,\\"" Potzsch returns to Schongau in the winter of 1648.  A terrible fever plagues the good villagers, the the young daughter Simon cannot do much more than his quack father to halt its deadly spread.  A band of murderous thieves lurks in the woods, cutting off Schongau from its lifeline of trade to the rest of Bavaria.  And on top of everything else, somebody has poisoned the beloved village priest.<br /><br />These are, as they say, dark days.  It's fitting that a Dark Monk be heavily involved.<br /><br />What ensues is a dizzying treasure hunt for Templar treasure, buried somewhere in Bavaria, sandwiched in between Kuisl's manhunt against the hidden robbers and, ultimately, the search for religious truth in a land riven by the Reformation.  The Bavaria of 1648 was a land where Catholics and Protestants were never far from deadly violence, and when fighting over some of the most precious treasures in Christendom, you can be sure that nobody will hold anything back.<br /><br />In this lethal game, Potzsch shows that he's still got it in terms of whisking the reader back to the 17th century.  Almost everything seems period-appropriate, including the rampant ignorance of even the most enlightened characters.  While \\""TDM\\"" gets a little strained in the solve-a-riddle-only-to-be-confronted-with-another-riddle plot that Dan Brown exploited so well, Potzsch keeps things moving along swiftly enough that you don't care too much.<br /><br />All in all, this is another solid entry in what promises to be a worthy series.

286,0393060691,5,"Conscience of a Liberal gives a political and economic history of the twentieth century, highlighting the way economic inequality has been shaped by political activism by far-right \\""movement conservatives,\\"" who got their start in the 1960s but didn't come to political power until the 1980s.<br /><br />The Good: Krugman's book is well argued and written for a general audience. You don't have to have ever taken an economics class to understand his arguments and conclusion. Krugman goes into a lot of detail showing how \\""movement conservatism\\"" has aimed to repeal the FDR's New Deal and create a new Gilded Age of economic inequality and has used race issues as a primary distraction, while promoting economic ideas that favor the wealthiest Americans and hurt most voters. It isn't possible to do these arguments justice in a short review. I recommend Conscience of a Liberal because it presents these arguments in ways that are both easy to understand and historically comprehensive.<br /><br />The Bad: Conscience of a Liberal seems dated now. Written in 2007, it doesn't reflect the rise of the Tea Party, Occupy Wall-Street, Citizens United or the dominance of austerity rhetoric currently floating around. That being said, I think a lot of these events fit in line with Krugman's general premises.<br /><br />As I said before, Conscience of a Liberal is written for a general audience, so a lot of the criticism against it has been that it is weaker on economic arguments and overtly political. However, this is the entire premise of the book: that political conditions have a great sway over the economy, particularly when it comes to inequality.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Conscience of a Liberal is a great book that details the rise of economic inequality and the main reason behind it."

We were concerned about future dental problems and really needed something to lovingly help her stop this habit.  We found Thumbuddy to Love Ballerina Sue through a friend and our problems were solved.  Our daughter loved the book, which has darling illustrations and wonderful prose.  The puppet was an instant hit and within 2 weeks she had given up on her thumb!  We are so relieved to see that she is no longer thumb sucking and was able to quit without tears and frustration.<br /><br />Thank you Thumbuddy!!!"
294,0300181299,5,"Some reviewers don't seem to know their Van Gogh or the period in which he painted. He painted at the end of the impressionist period and basically in their style. Paintings of that time had a \\""blurry\\"" look to them. It is not that the pics. were out of focus as a reviewer has suggested. Secondly the up-close refers to the fact that he viewed his subjects up-close. It is not that photos of his works were going to be taken up-close as another reviewer said! It is a nice big book, full of pics. and information."

He goes around burping and tooting all the time without worrying what people think or say.  His parents decide to turn the tables on him at dinner one night and he is shocked by their behavior.  He resolves to try and do better when they explain that they were just doing what he did.<br /><br />This book has a cute little monkey that reminds me of typical little boys.  It also shows them that this is not accepted behavior and that they need to learn to control their actions.  The book was fun and the illustrations were wonderful.  Lilly thought that Pete the Monkey was silly.<br /><br />Overall, Lilly & I give Terrible, Awful, Horrible Manners 4 Stars."

299,0871136821,2,"Throughout the book I felt little sympathy for Alexandra, the insipid, self-centred, child neglecting, actress whose shallow experience was deepened by the sudden death of her husband and the subsequent revelations that recast her whole married life. Weldon deliberately undermines our sympathy for Alexandra by emphasising her acquiescence in the face of every other character.  Her thoughts are peppered with compulsive cash valuations of everything she looks at. I felt schadenfreude when her husband's voice delivered the final confirmation of the lie that she had been living through his betrayal and her vanity. Weldon's conclusion is a damp squib which sees Alexandra sailing into the future looking forward to doing it all again."
300,0393088774,5,"I have been following Paul Krugman's blog on the NY Times for several years now, and my understanding of macroeconomics has improved greatly as a result. Most of the ideas in the book are ones that he's discussed on his blog, but they've been compiled into an enjoyable, concise book. I highly recommend reading it for anyone who wants to learn more about the way the economy works."

305,1470095718,3,"I just started reading this book recently on Kindle for my phone, and it seems interesting so far. My only complaint is did the author use an editor or proofreader for this book? If not, for Mike's next book he definitely should pay someone to proofread it for him. With all the punctuation mistakes and grammatical errors, it takes away from the story. Good read so far though, even with the errors."

314,0525952489,2,"The low rating on this book is to a great degree because of my personal tastes. I concur with a number of those that rated the book a \\""3\\"" but my personal preferences lower this one level.  It was the basis of a good story; but totally unrealistic and overly graphic.<br /><br />The story is about a renegade detective (Carl) who is sidelined within his department.  He was shot with others while on duty so they can't fire him.  They give him a special assignment to lead a cold case department of one employee (himself).  He quickly assesses the situation from a \\""political perspective\\"" and ultimately lobbies for an assistant (Assad), a quirky Arab guy, and receives a few other perks .  Still, they are relegated to a basement office and all that implies.<br /><br />The chapters switch back and forth as many do today with American authors.  Here, the chapters vary between the current day with Carl trying to solve a missing person cold case and the alternate chapters with a running history of what happened to the missing person.  The missing person chapters are very detailed and very graphic to the point where I soon felt the specifics added nothing expect to feed gruesome detail to people who like to read that kind of thing.  I skipped many paragraphs and ultimate pages in those sections - a little of that and \\""you get it\\""!<br /><br />Like many reviewers, I found the main character a total \\""turn-off\\"", an over-baked macho guy.  If you were to take almost every situation and ask how someone could behave to be purposely obstinate - this guy would win first prize.  Assad however was a true \\""character\\"" who appeals throughout the book.  The rest of the characters are \\""plastic\\"".  The primary female  characters are all beautiful; the  females in lesser roles are in various stages of \\""dumpy\\"".  The other detectives and their leaders are exactly as they are in many books and TV serials portray them as supporting characters.<br /><br />I did read the entire book.  After a slow start (first 40 + pages) the mystery became interesting but ultimately it fizzled out to a very predictable, \\""please spare me ...\\"", ending.  At too many junctures in my reading, I felt as if this was a test plot for an American TV series to see how the \\""idea would play\\"".  Obviously there's a large audience for this type of book but as indicated prior it's just not to my tastes and preferences.  (It would possibly have been a \\""3\\"" otherwise.)  However, per a book jacket comparison parallel to Henning Mankell - this doesn't even come close."

323,1604145536,5,"Mondays with Mary<br /><br />Author: Sam Oliver<br /><br />Within your heart lies the inner most thoughts, fears and desires live. Life does not always present itself in the way we would like and we have to learn how to deal with its many obstacles on our journey from beginning to end. Jim was a counselor working with many patients in a Hospice setting and hopefully providing them with the ability to analyze their thoughts and allow their emotions to come out from within in order to be able to evaluate their life experiences. Not an easy task. Jim often visited another dimension while asleep which allowed him to release his own tensions, feel the weightless of in his body reduced to that of a feather and allow him to experience peace. Author Sam Oliver creates a world for Jim while sleeping so beautifully described and depicted with the Gardens below him, the mountains, water and the lakes so amazingly clear that you feel that you are experiencing it with him. You can hear the splashing of the water, see the ripples as if someone dropped a pebble and viewing the magnificent horizon and then a vision of a man took hold and he was no longer alone. Imagine being in the Garden Of Gods and Meeting the Angel of Promise. Just why he was drawn to him will now be revealed as the Angel explains he is concerned about he unrest within Jim's heart and the need for him to communicate it with him.<br /><br />Amazing to think and understand the within all of us the Angel shares is a secret garden you call life. This garden helps you to connect to \\"" all that ever has, is and will be.\\"" This secret garden will allow you to find the place your soul calls home. Within this garden and your heart you will understand your inner thoughts, feelings and dreams that can relate to your life everyday. Jim needed to find and visit his creative side and for this he contacted his friend Elizabeth who ran a volunteer program. She then introduced him to a man named Larry and from there things would change for Jim and his perspective on life and how to help others would too. Looking for the good in a person and showing how to expand and appreciate their lives is part of what Larry does.<br /><br />Jim meets Mary as a result of Larry taking a leave of absence and Elizabeth thinking that they would work well together. Mary is special. She has very little time left and yet she understands life and its true meaning. What she teaches Jim about the importance of taking time for his emotions and himself we all need to do. What she teaches him and they share about the Angel of Promise and how this special Angel encourages them both to embrace life, their inner most thoughts and how he needs to take time to really hear what others say, look deep within his heart, breath and focus harder on the words of others in order to help them is precious.<br /><br />More than just words a hard concept for most people to understand. Mary explains that Jim needs to release his control of his environment with words and let the language of his soul emerge into unconditional love and your mind will expand. As Jim recalled his feelings for his first grade teacher he realized that what he really learned and felt was the joy of learning that she imparted to him and her students. Ms. Bee did what we hope all educators would do and that is placing in the heart of all learners/students the love for learning and sharing her knowledge with them. Jim learned more than that this Monday as you will learn when you read it for yourself and open your mind to find your creative imagination and soul. What we do in life should not be what others expect of us or require so much effort. Jim loves to write and one assignment for a paper would change not only the way he sees life but his perspective about what he wanted to do in life.<br /><br />When I write a review the words seem to come to me as I place on hands on the keyboard and allow my thoughts to flow naturally without even thinking about the wordsthat are being written. Someone once asked me how I could read a book and find the soul or understand the author's message. After listening to both Jim and Mary I think I final understand something that I never really thought about before. When you open your heart and \\""allow Eternity to breath in through you your mind and heart are expanding these moments are called Inspiration.\\"" Making a different in this world because of his writing is why he is here and sharing his feelings is like a bridge between Heaven and Earth. He now understands a many writers might not but will after reading this book that we /Jim are vehicles to explain the awareness given to us in words and create them in written form. The rest of what he learned and how he began to understand the meaning of imagination you need to read in the chapter titled Your Creative Imagination.<br />Close your eyes and you too might here the Angel Promise. Listen to your heart, silence your mind and heart the wisdom it brings into your life. Within all of us is a choice maker that allows us to choose what you want out of life. That choice maker, Mary states through the author is the Real You, which is your eternal nature. The time between visits seemed longer to Jim as he missed seeing Mary and longed for his visits. We have all done reviews of books, shows we have seen or even events that we have experienced. But, how many of us have taken the time to do a Life Review? How many of us spend time saying What if I did that differently, what if something changed when we know in our hearts and mind that will never happen? When you finally understand a life review you will find a place in a broken heart and allow it \\"" to heal on the level of soul what could not be done in our physical lives.\\"" As Mary can no longer communicate Jim needs to listen closely and understand that he will always hear her voice and she will always be with him. Can you feel her presence? Do you see her face? Do you see the Golden Light? Death ishard to deal with and the living sometimes needs to understand that they have a purpose in life that they need to share. The ending of the book is quite telling and different from what you might expect and one person can only teach the final lessons that Jim learns. What Jim learns you will have to read for yourself when you open your heart, mind and soul and find the place where unconditional love exists and your most sacred thought and desires exists. As Mary says: break free of conditions and you too will know where she is and exists.<br /><br />Author Sam Oliver gives the reader much to think about and a unique perspective on how we should deal with many different situations in life, how a relationship, even a short one with someone that is dying can enrich our lives forever. Monday's With Mary is a special book that will help anyone that wants to find their inner you, real you and unconditional love and that place when you read it you will understand where Mary is and where Jim has already learned. When your creative imagination enters places you remember from your youth allow yourself to open you heart and mind and take yourself on that journey with Jim, Mary and allow yourself to be open to some many wonderful life-changing possibilities.<br /><br />This book gets FIVE GOLDEN ANGELS NAMED MARY"
324,0380799006,5,This book is nicely laid out and has some basic common sense ideas that we as parent wouldn't otherwise think of. Great way to avoid confrontation and delicately deal with such a crucial subject with our kids. We are finding this book very helpful.
325,0307588955,5,"As a mom of two children with very different shades of Autism, I find myself reading books about life-skills often. Usually I put them down and ask, \\""but what do I DO?\\"" Not so with this guide. Many times I thought, \\""OK, I can do that.\\""<br />This book excels in real life, step-by-step planning and teaching of essential everyday skills. Shoe-tying...CHECK; dressing...CHECK; toileting...CHECK and while we're in the bathroom, hand-washing too! You'll find topics specific to girls and boys, toddler to teen.<br />The author empowers the caregiver with the notion that they are in fact, the most influential teacher in their child's life. Despite the title, this book is not just useful for parents of Asperger or high functioning autistics. There isn't a child on the spectrum (or this planet) that wouldn't benefit from the tools available in this guide."

327,0061668125,5,"My aunt first bought Wings for me shortly after it came out and I fell in love. Spells and Illusions did not disappoint, especially with the cliffhanger at the end of Illusions! Waiting for Destined to come out seemed to take forever but the wait was totally worth it. Aprilynne Pike left no questions unanswered and the detail in this book is so detailed, often times I felt as though I was watching a movie with epic battles like Lord of the Rings, Troy, or Kingdom of Heaven. So incredibly action packed! I always tend to feel very emotionally invested in the books that I read and this book was no different. There were parts that had me cheering out loud, had me laughing out loud, had me feeling butterflies in my tummy, and had me crying. (I ended the book in tears.)<br /><br />I feel such sorrow that this series is over but I've already read the first 3 books at least 3 times and I foresee myself re-reading this whole series many times in the future so I can relive this incredible story.<br /><br />There was so much going on in this book that it's hard to recap it all here without just copying every detail of the book. Suffice it to say, I am completely satisfied with how the story ends! <3<br /><br />** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS **<br />** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS **<br />** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS **<br />** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS **<br /><br />The first ending was so nice and happy! The second ending was definitely bittersweet. At least Aprilynne Pike warned of that. I was beyond excited that Laurel finally chose Tamani and they ended up together forever. It was perfect!!! I was hoping we'd get to see some of Chelsea finally getting to be with David, and the second ending with David's letter touches on that a little, but David didn't have the happy ending that everyone else seemed to get. The experiences the gang had in Avalon really hit David hard and he had a really difficult time getting over it. It haunted him so much that he convinced Laurel (with Tamani's assistance) to give him an elixir to erase his memory of Avalon, and ultimately most of his memory of Laurel. This was so very sad and I felt pain for David. I love the fact that David and Tamani had become so close as shown by his final line in his letter to Chelsea.<br /><br />Shar's death was just... sigh. Yuki's death was surprisingly sad. Jamison's plan was amazing. Chelsea was so fantastically brave and David with Excalibur, it was so amazing to see that they were not only allowed through the gate to Avalon but that they had such a huge part in saving it!"
328,0062024043,4,"Sequels to stand out debuts often struggle to advance the series plot and recapture the magic of the first book. INSURGENT isn't one of those sequels. It's as powerful or even more powerful than it's predecessor. And considering how phenomenal DIVERGENT was, that's no small compliment.<br /><br />One of the most inventive and action packed dystopian series ever, INSURGENT picks up almost immediately after the end of DIVERGENT.  The factions that dictate every aspect of society are in danger and all out war seems inevitable. Tris's faction has ben split as too many members have turned traitor.  Power hungry Erudite have set their sights on the Divergent, like Tris, systematically rounding them up to kill...and worse.<br /><br />What continues to impress me with the Divergent series is the character arcs.  They are magnificent.  Tris transformed from the almost Amish-like Abnegation member to a brave and confrontational Dauntless member so convincingly in DIVERGENT, and her transformation in INSURGENT is no less impressive.  After the tragic choice she made at the end of DIVERGENT, Tris is plagued with guilt, self recrimination, and shame.  She isolates herself even from those she cares about the most. It's heartbreaking to read. And Tris isn't the only one who evolves in the book.  Characters who I thought were villains became heroes, and characters who I thought were trustworthy became villains.  Shocking doesn't begin to describe it.<br /><br />The beginning of INSURGENT was a little slow and not as easy to jump into as the debut, especially since the worldbuilding isn't really recapped for readers (like me) who could have benefitted from a refresher. But once I got my bearings, and the central conflict was revealed, INSURGENT was as compulsively readable as DIVERGENT.  And the revelations at the end were almost overwhelming--in a good way--considering their implications.  Bottom line, this is a series not to be missed.  The stakes just keep getting higher and I can't wait to dive into the third book in the Divergent series when it comes out in 2013.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissingn't wait to dive into the third book in the Divergent series when it comes out in 2013.<br /><br />Sexual Content:<br />Kissing"

330,1433530031,4,"Matt Chandler's The Explicit Gospel is a sweet look at the good news of Jesus Christ from more than one angle. Chandler challenges his readers to look at the gospel from both an individual (what he calls on the ground) and global (what he calls in the air) perspective.<br />Positives<br /> The strength of this book is in the gospel content. Chandler uses both a \\""God, Man, Christ, Response\\"" model of explaining the gospel as well as a \\""Creation, Fall, Reconciliation, Consummation\\"" model. It is a good thing for believers to see the gospel from these two angles, the former pointing to the theology of individual redemption and the latter pointing to the ultimate story of God's plan for the world. In both explanations, Chandler communicates the truth of scripture with clarity and refreshing sweetness.<br /> Chandler also wisely points out many common weaknesses in our gospel understanding. He shows us how, if we focus too strongly on the individual or global perspectives, we will pervert our understanding of the gospel. He also challenges his readers not to give into our common temptation to believe a grace-based gospel but to live as though our salvation were works-based.<br />Negatives<br /> I found two areas that made this book less than perfect in my view. First and foremost is Chandler's dealing with the issue of creation at the beginning of part 2 of this work. Chandler claims to hold to \\""historic creationism,\\"" a position which allows for a great passage of time in the opening phrase of Genesis 1:1. This position is Chandler's way of believing in a literal 6-day creation, while allowing room for an old-earth view. I believe the author's position here to be incorrect and to open the door to theological errors that are more significant. I might not give this problem a full paragraph did Chandler not spend so much time in his book defending his view.<br /> Another much smaller problem that I had with the book was an occasional earthiness to Chandler's language that seems out-of-place. The example that comes to my mind is in the look at the life of Job. Chandler uses a line I have heard other preachers use to describe God's confrontation of Job, telling Job that he needs to \\""put on a cup\\"" to face what is coming. This is not by any means a wrong thing to say, but it does take the conversation to a slightly more crass level than some might appreciate.<br />Conclusion<br /> Much is very right with The Explicit Gospel. For a more mature Christian who is willing to think critically about the arguments raised in this book, especially that regarding creation, the book is a solid reminder of important truth. The challenge to see the gospel from a ground-level and an aerial view is quite valuable. However, even though I was blessed and encouraged by Chandler's writing, I would only recommend this book with reservations, as the issue with the creation argument is, in my view, significant.<br />Audio<br /> I received an audio copy of this book to review as part of the reviewers program at ChristianAudio.com. The book is very well-read and pleasant to hear."
331,0802409318,5,"I have been a keen reader of all of Sayer's books and was eagerly awaiting this one. I am confident that it is his most important work so far.<br /><br />Anyone who is familiar with his writing or speaking will know his signature mix of meta-cultural reading meets prophetic voice and solution. I repeatedly found myself thinking \\""how does he know that's what I think?\\"" his poignancy is like a punch to the stomach at times. At other moments in the book I found myself wanting to cry as he paints his stunning pictures of the redemption of the church and the self.<br /><br />This is a vastly important book for anyone ministering to youth or young adults, or anyone wanting to understand how our culture of `the road' has infiltrated and subverted God's church. As a minister myself I will be re-reading this book and bringing it's implications to my congregation.<br /><br />Funny, gentle, shocking and nourishing. I'll be buying it for all of my friends."

333,1856176029,1,"First, I would like to start by saying in the author's note inside the book she states she wrote her textbook so the everyday person could understand it and that she gets to the point.  Not true, the book is very confusing to understand and the author drags out many parts unnecessarily.  It was like pulling teeth to read this book.  Tourism is an interesting subject and can be vividly illustrated and relatable, the author failed at this.<br /><br />I do want to note that this is written by a woman in the U.K, which makes some wording a bit confusing to understand, but the content is just not there."
334,0307378721,1,"What can I say - at the halfway point I just couldn't muster the strength to go on.  Looking at reviews here, 2 themes resonate with my feelings about this book:<br /><br />1) You need to have a good understanding of Watergate to follow and enjoy this.<br />2) It's tragically dull.  Even many of those who lived through the events of the day felt this way.<br /><br />I also felt this was more like reading People Magazine than a historical fiction.  If I cared about the extracurricular sleeping habits of the rich and famous, I would spend more time with People.<br /><br />I don't like giving 1-star ratings; I reserve them for the very special class of books that drain the will to continue from my very soul.  Watergate: A Novel - for me - is eminently qualified for this honor."

336,0515150460,5,Madeline Hunter is one of my favorite authors. I had been a little worried about this book becuase I was not entirely sold on the plot summary but am so glad I went ahead and read this.  Darius is a wonderful hero and watching his relationship develop with Emma was delighful.  Emma was forced to make a hard choice towards the end of the novel and I loved how Darius handled it.  Highly recommend this book!
337,0806533641,5,A thoroughly entertaining read from beginning to end. The author manages to craft an excellent narrative that holds up under a very challenging premise. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in reading something creative and engaging.
338,0536220794,5,Excellent math book.  Good explanations and put together in a great order.  This book is good for two classes at most junior colleges and that saves us poor college students money.  I would recommend this book over the single class book.  Very robust cover helps keep it in good shape for multiple classes.

Seems to be very authentic Japanese, which means many of the ingredients would be hard to find in the US.

341,1935254685,5,"As someone that has worked in higher education for some time, I can honestly say that this book does offer some great insights into what you should and should not do when it comes to interacting with your professors. Some of the points are common sense (if you have attended college in the past), but there are also some real hidden gems in the book as well which made me say, yes, this author really know what she is talking about. What I loved most about the book was that the author is a professor and she is sharing her own experiences in the classroom with the reader, and this type of experience is so valuable for all readers to know as it is this experience that makes the book as valuable as it is. The book has a light tone, but it is very heavy in details and  information and is truly a resource that any current college student or soon-to-be college student should read!"

In addition to being out of date on that front, free Internet sites have beefed up advice, and provide as much information for no charge.  I bought it for the chapter on leasing, but that chapter was really thin.  The author advises the reader to go to Leaseguide.com and buy the $19.95 Lease Kit.  Sorry, but save your money and use the many good online sources.  I returned this book."

I have Little Master Carroll and Little Miss Brontë in front of me, but there are several more available in Jennifer Adams's new series for budding bibliophiles.<br /><br />The Alice in Wonderland adaptation is a \\""colors primer\\""; the Jane Eyre a \\""counting primer.\\"" Both incorporate imaginative, beautiful, captivating images by Alison Oliver inspired by the classics they emulate.  They are not summaries of the plots by any means, giving only the merest nods to the originals.  But they are baby picture books, after all, not graphic novels.<br /><br />I don't have a baby or a toddler to read them with, and can't speculate as to what holds a two-year old's attention, book-wise.  The boards seem plenty sturdy for little teeth and slick enough not to absorb drool, which seems like a good endorsement for a baby book.<br /><br />For me, the point of these is that they are super cute for adults trying to indoctrinate tiny readers early into a book culture -- either those adults actually reading to the little tykes or, like me, those looking for something fresh and clever to give as gifts to the newborns we come across."

353,0395142555,5,"As the first reviewer stated, the Dolciani books were the best.  As a ex-math teacher, I was not only taught on the Dolciani books in the 60s, but also taught from the Dolciani books while I had a short stint as a teacher (I latter went into retailing as a Buyer, so my math background was useful).  Dolciani books and Houghton Mifflin were the king and queen of the secondary math textbooks from mid 1960 through the early 90s.  Once she passed, in 1985, there were several revisions to her texts, but other authors, notably Richard Brown became the major writer and the quality, the thoughtfulness and the structure went out of the books.  No individual and certainly no woman did more to make math accessible to all as did Dr. Dolciani.  I learned Algebra 1 on the original version of this text, and taught Algebra 1 from this version, the second edition.  I still have my Teacher's Edition.  This book is a classic, it is thorough, well worked out with examples, easy to read, but mathematically sound.  It should be noted her Mathematical Analysis text is the best Pre-Calculus book ever written, nothing has ever come close.  If you want to purchase any math text from Amazon, to help your child or yourself, it should be a Dolciani book.  She was simply that amazing of a math author."

Breaking the rules is punishable by death, and they're followed around constantly by video cameras.<br /><br />This story reminded me a lot of \\""The Maze Runner,\\"" but I think I liked this one better, due to the crazy plot twists that really kept me guessing up until the last pages. I hadn't realized it was part of a series, so the end disappointed me, only because I was really hoping to have more questions answered, and now I guess I'll have to wait until October"

358,0399159126,5,"I picked this book up to read for my breaks at work, and once I started, I couldn't put it down.  I was completely unproductive for the full day, reading at any free moment.  I sometimes don't love the detailed back story of a protaganist, wanting instead to get to the meat of the story, but Nora Roberts drew me in with the excellently written Elizabeth/Abigail.  I think the true strength of this story was in the relationship between her and Brooks; I know, duh, but sometimes, the suspense of the story is an equal part to the relationship for NR books (like The Search or Sanctuary).  However, here the suspense was not as present.  It was always there of course, b/c the whole reason for the character name change and the growth of her relationship ties directly to the horrific experiences she had.  I was okay with this b/c Elizabeth/Abigail's growth as someone who could actually have a relationship, and even more, a romantic relationship was the big development.  And it was good.  Really good.  Her two steps forward/one step back was very believable, and we should all be so lucky to have a Brooks in our lives.  All in all, a book I will be happy to revisit in the future."
359,0741466929,5,"As a mother of a child with high functioning autism/aspergers syndrome I found this book an absolute must read. Many of Brigid's experiences with Danny I was able to relate to and it helps to know others have gone through similar experiences and to see how they dealt with them. Brigid writes from the heart sharing little anecdotal stories that help to build a picture of her life. She takes you on an emotional roller coaster thats hard to get off, hence I did not put the book down until I had finished it."
360,0802404448,5,"This book reminded me of a Cloud & Townsend book because it was intelligent, easy to read, and encouraging in that way that makes you feel both free and motivated. I think he gave such a gracious challenge to rethink how Christian culture often interprets \\""stigma\\"" feelings (the focus was on anxiety, but I think it could be applied to other difficult feelings such as shame), and instead how to see those feelings from the perspective of \\""what is God trying to tell me through this?\\"" As a therapist, he encourages professional counseling and even gives a host of helpful resources in the back. This would be a great book for a small group because he provides really great questions and exercises at the end of each chapter. Jon Acuff hit the nail on the head in the foreword when he said this book is \\""part memoir, part manual.\\"" I'll keep recommending this one."

365,0890155178,5,"To be completely fair and partial, I have a personal connection to this book because my father is one of the characters. He would never admit to whom, but I have a decent idea. That being said, I can see why he rarely spoke of WWII other than to tell a quick story, and I can see why we never went to Europe through all the travels we took during his life.<br /><br />Back to the book, as a woman who enjoys a lot of Hemingway, just as much as I enjoy a lot of the Hunger Games-type books, I really liked this. It's a little male-oriented (it's guns, it's fighting---but it's the truth), but now as we sit during times of war, to understand it in any capacity, studying it's history is important.<br /><br />Ready does a great job of telling a tale of espionage, a tale of war, but also a tale of really young men, who are thrown into this battle of not only war, but life.<br /><br />For anyone that loves a good war book or a good espionage book, I strongly recommend this."

I found the book to a refreshing approach to moving forward centered around concept of Preparation, Planting and Producing.  Prepare by reflecting on what is holding you back; Plant by setting goals with a framework of hope and expectation and Produce by growing beyond comfort zone and pruning what is getting in the way.  And best of all, each chapter comes with easy to do assignments to make it all real.  Highly recommend.  Also appreciated the strong spiritual foundation underlying the messages."
368,0399521372,3,"I appreciate the thoughtfulness and positiveness of many of the other reviews. But I have to say, my view of this book is different. I suppose this comes from my own experience, contrasted with the basic assumptions of Notarius. His book deals with the harmful thought patterns that govern (and can eventually destroy) our relationships. I guess where I take issue with him is his emphasis on thought patterns themselves.<br /><br />In my own relationships, I have never found thought patterns to be the dominant force. Instead, I have found habitual interactions themselves to be the problem. That is, it's a kind of bad dance that the other person and I just can't help doing together. So to improve the relationship, it's necessary to change the interactions. (For approaching relationship problems this way, I'd suggest [[ASIN:0963878417 The Couple's Survival Workbook: What You Can Do To Reconnect With Your Partner and Make Your Marriage Work]] by Olsen and Stephens.<br /><br />Perhaps other readers may have different experiences, but I'll simply say the following: If you're looking for simple and practical advice that's aimed squarely at improving your relationship interactions, I suggest you look somewhere else."

It's a natural, as London's such a fitting home for both in the originals.  Here Estleman weaves Holmes into the regular Stoker story with a sort of Rosencrantz & Guildenstern approach, showing you how Holmes moved behind the scenes to prevent Van Helsing and crew from becoming the Count's next victims.  My favorite part of this is actually Watson's role, particularly near the end, as Watson's bravery and loyalty aren't always made enough of, and deserve the nod that Estelman gives them here.

It is more than just a report on Francis Asbury, it is the history of the Methdodist Church in America.  I bought one for myself, one as a gift, and one for our Church Library.  Furthermore, this book, interesting within itself, in the history and hardships of a growing movement, prompted me to look for the actual journals of Francis Asbury as they too are the written history of my denomination.

378,0890516499,5,"As a Christian I have often heard non-Christian, and even uneducated, luke-warm Christans, mention contradictions in God's Word. I haven't given it much thought, instead choosing to have the faith as a child and just know that God didn't make any mistakes, that it must be through the interpretation that there was error.<br />That is exactly what this book is intended for, working out those interpretations and bringing them into the light through additional passage references, looking at the times during when they were written, and taking into account translation from the original Word.<br />40 supposed contradictions from Genesis through Revelation.

I remember reading them then and thinking they were a great treasure to remember. Being of little memory, I of course didn't retain them from that and was so glad to see them written in this second volume of Demolishing Strongholds.<br />This is a book to read through, and get an understanding of the scriptures that those questioning the faith may present to you as contradicting. It is an excellent reference to hang on to when those times present themselves and you may or may not as in my limited memory be able to give a solid reason why. I can always say, hold on.. I have a book on that!!<br />From a homeschool Mom standpoint I think this would be a wonderful book for the teens to read and reference as well.

380,0525952667,5,"This is an excellent book.<br /><br />One reason you can quickly tell it is good:  just by googling it, you can find intelligent discussions both pro and con Tyler Cowen's conclusions.  But, as stated by the author himself, the goal is to inculcate a lens of viewing things which allows the reader to observe and draw their own conclusions about how the world of food works.  This is a nuanced view of economics, which blends conventional price theory with other items such as behavioral economics, substitutes and complements, network effects, and the evolutionarily stable strategies of game theory.<br /><br />Tyler deftly applies insights from the dry topics above to something universally accessible and fun: food.  The pages crackle with Tyler's humane, deep appreciation of food and food culture, and how it is no mere commodity, but an essential part of what makes us human.  Don't be fooled by the title: this is a book rich in culture and insight into the human condition. Recommended for foodies and humanists alike."

382,B001PS7NL0,4,"I also endorse this dictionary with some considerable exceptions. First, and foremost, the example sentences provided are entirely devoid of a specified context. Any language instructor worth his/her salt understands that it is not so much learning to say things in the language as it is \\""learning to do in a language\\"" (Galal Walker). Thus, it would be of more worth to have the example sentences couched within specified contexts to allow learners to learn to use them within those constraints.<br /><br />Second, this book is targeted at an intermediate audience and yet the fact that it has eliminated the romanized text from the examples sentences doubles the difficulty inherent in the task of learning new grammar. It essentially causes the example sentences to become vocabulary and kanji acquisition tasks on top of the grammatical acquisition task it promotes.<br /><br />These weaknesses being considered, I still heartily endorse this book and the other two in the series as they are perhaps the most comprehensive compilation of Japanese grammar items available. The hallmark of each book is not only the vastness of the items introduced and discussed in the series, but also the in-depth analyses given regarding the subtle differences between semantically similar grammatical items (e.g. node and kara)."

When I discovered that there was an annotated printing that also included information and samples from the myriad of other illustrators who had worked on this story over the years, as well as a forward and side comments by Seth Lerer--whose [[ASIN:023113794X Inventing English: A Portable History of the Language]] I think is a wonderful book--I had to buy [[ASIN:0674034473 The Wind in the Willows: An Annotated Edition]]. I was not disappointed, and neither will you be.<br /><br />Whether you (or your child) is new to the magical world of Rat, Mole and Mr. Toad, or they are old friends for you as they are for me, you will appreciate the loving care with which this volume was created. Kenneth Graham's story can of course stand alone, as can Earnest Shepherd's wonderful drawings, but put together with Professor Lerer's insightful comments this is just the best version of this classic available.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all!"

It explains how to market a business on Google through Adwords (the Ads you see  the side of a Google Search) and Ad placement (You can pay for your ad to be placed page one rather than page 20 of a Google Search).  While the images in the book are helpful, everything in this book can be found by simply doing a Google search.<br /><br />SideBar: Running a Google ad campaign is VERY expensive.

387,0062082353,4,"\\""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History\\"" by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice is an engaging account of Chris Kyle's time as a Navy SEAL, where he became a SEAL sniper and amassed an amazing amount of confirmed kills, and who knows how many probables.  Having been an Army sniper, and having known a number of Vietnam era and more recent snipers, I understand what goes into confirmed kills, and that is why I state that Kyle amassed an amazing number of them.<br /><br />There are many reviews of this book, both good and bad.  I agree, as a shooter, that I'd have liked a little more description and focus on some of the actual sniping.  Yes, I wanted a few more details.  However, what I really liked is that the book allows you to get to know Kyle a bit, as a person, not a cold calculating killing machine that some might think a SEAL sniper is.<br /><br />Obviously, when it comes to a sniper with the confirmed kills that Kyle has, comparisons to Carlos Hathcock, the famed Marine sniper from Vietnam will be made.  I knew Hathcock, and have fond memories of our conversations and exchanges through the mail.  I was very pleased to see Kyle honor him in the pages of this book.  According to Kyle, \\""he was and always will be the greatest sniper ever.\\""<br /><br />Some might not have liked the passages written by Kyle's wife, Taya, but I found them to add some of the personality of the book.  The fact is, when people in the military are deployed, there are those at home who are impacted.  It was good to see this, and how the relationship was effected by Kyle's deployments and his feelings toward country and family, and how those feelings matured and why he finally got out of the military and devoted time to his family.  (Even if he did feel some guilt over this.)<br /><br />I was working security the other night and couldn't help but think of Kyle when a number of people didn't stop walking around the stadium when the National Anthem was playing.  I liked Kyle's passage about speaking up to people like that, and I myself have done the same.  It was these little things that made my like Kyle more, and that added to the book.<br /><br />This is not an action packed account of sniper missions, but rather a mildly sanitized account of one man's (and his wife's) story of become a Navy SEAL sniper and what that journey encompassed, and how it effected him, and where he went next.  I enjoyed reading his story, and I feel I'd enjoy getting to know Chris Kyle.  I'd have liked to have had more detail on certain sniping missions and tactics, and I can understand how some people might not like this straight forward attitude on things.  I'm glad I read this book, but I give it four stars when compared to Hatchcock's story's five.

392,0062085611,4,"This has to be one of the best angel books to ever hit the shelves! Not just because the angel lore was completely original or because there's a boy with an English accent, but because Wendy Higgins must be an angel in disguise since she writes them so well.<br /><br />In Sweet Evil, the sole purpose of Nephilim is to be a bad influence to humans. But that's not as easy as it sounds when the angel hierarchy is so complicated. When we learn everything along with Anna in the beginning, it's hard not to say, \\""Wow!\\"" because the lore is captivating. And the demon action, especially in the end? It will give you chills!<br /><br />At first I didn't know what to think of Anna. She seemed too good and too sweet at times to be real. But she grew on me so fast and showed how even though she wasn't outwardly bad-ass, she was still one of the strongest, most determined heroines out there. She stood her ground when most girls wouldn't have, and I ended up adoring her completely.<br /><br />Her romance with the English-accented Kaidan Rowe (son of the demon of Lust) may take front and center once they take off on a road trip together to find out more about Anna's past, but it's in no way overwhelming! It's the sweet, not-so-innocent pull between opposites that will make you grin. Along with the fantastic interactions with their demonic fathers and with their friends, Sweet Evil is filled with well-written relationships.<br /><br />Both sweet and sensual, Sweet Evil is an angel book that will steal your breath, your heart, and maybe a little bit of your innocence at the exact same time. It took a few chapters to hook me in (although that may have to do with the fact I read it after a particularly epic book), but in the end, it was AWESOME and I'd definitely recommend it!<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: English boy fan? Buy it! Angel book fan? Buy it! All-books-in-general fan? Buy it! I think you know where I'm going with this... ;)"
393,0814633684,5,"This is one of the best summaries and explanations of the documents of Vatican II that has ever been printed.  The authors do a superb job of explaining the history and background of each article and excerpting a quote from the appropriate document voted on by the Council Fathers.  One does not need to be a theologian to understand what was voted upon and what effect the article has on the People of God.  I recommend this highly for anyone interested in learning more about what occurred at Vatican II and why.  There is an attempt to reform the Reform; but the Council Fathers did a great job nearly 50 years ago.  We would all do well to leave it alone and allow the Holy Spirit to work without help from every reactionary from Rome to Lincole,NE."
394,140006841X,5,"This is a good book, filled with well thought out analyses, lots of cogent facts and many good ideas. Will all or many of them be adopted? Probably not. Should all of them be adopted? Probably not. That should deter one from reading it and trying to make the difficult possible because the core ideas, if adopted, would make America a better place.<br /><br />The book has been well reviewed in The Guardian, where Robert Sidelsky, a Professor of Economics in Warwick, England, analyses the positives and negatives of the book and gives some of his own views on areas where he is not in agreement. He starts of by saying that it is one of the best books provoked by the economic crisis, and I agree with that, and have read many other books on this subject. His review is critical, substantive and well worth reading before and after you have read the book. The book is also reviewed in the Wall Street Journal by Paul Ryan, the developer of the Ryan Plan. Ryan says that the book's 'veneer of economic analysis cannot conceal what is essentially a crusade against the free enterprise ethic of our republic'. This is a reflection on Ryan and not the book. Either Ryan did not read the book or he did not understand it, which is very sad because he could learn something from it. Mr Sachs spends many chapters promoting the role of free enterprise and a market economy, but has a higher goal than that. A reviewer should not let his political view blind him to the intelligent analysis in the book. It does not matter whether you are liberal or conservative, one should recognize that the author has thought over many areas and is a well known economist who has contributed significantly to the economic development of many developing countries and has something worthwhile to say.<br /><br />Read the book, make your own judgment, think about it in global terms so we in the  USA can gain from the successes and examples in other countries. It should be prescribed reading for all who can think openly about the current problems in America."

403,0615412564,5,"After reading a number of thoughts and books on 9/11 and watching the videos and looking at the pictures of the towers coming down it was obvious to me that the official explanation wasn't right and a cover up.  The towers basically exploding and turning to dust is one of many glaring inconsistencies from that day, but one in which I hadn't thought about as much as the missing plane wreckage and damage to the Pentagon and the missing plane and dispersed debris at Shanksville.  Judy Wood takes apart the official lie of what happened in New York on 9/11 in excruciating detail.  This is a must have book because it is a scientific investigation of the towers coming down with an amazing amount of pictures and detailed maps of the area to give a full view and scope of the situation.<br /><br />Her conclusion of what brought the towers down, an energy weapon of some sort, isn't as far-fetched as it would first seem after she lays out the research into such science.  Since the end of WWII and during the long and purposeful Cold War a secret and powerful national security state was created in the United States where accountability and knowledge of what the government and corporations have been developing and implementing has been shrouded in secrecy.  This secrecy the many perpetrators and deceived would say is for our good.  We didn't want the enemy to know what we are doing and in this void of knowledge of what was going on behind this secrecy I don't think it is out of questions and probable that such a weapon, probably space based, was created and then used on 9/11.  Judy Wood gave us one of the keys to understanding a part of 9/11 with this book."

405,0918266203,5,"Most students of world affairs know something about the Middle East - more or less.  The region has been a routine topic for journalists for decades.  However, the area that gets the lion's share of attention is the Arab-Israeli dispute - for the obvious reasons.<br /><br />Recently, rebellion has broken out in the Arab camp, mass demonstrations, dictators ousted, killed.  To these developments the reaction of the press has been one of confounded surprise.  And that's where Allahu Akbar, a work of fiction, distinguishes itself, projecting change before the current state of affairs, and in the most sensitive and guarded of areas - the US - Israeli relationship.  The novel begins peacefully enough in New York City, in the Gothic majesty of the Woolworth Building, where the protagonist, Basil Primchek, a US educated Israeli, has been working as a journeyman architect for Shames, Garfield and Chase, a leading architectural firm.  These seemingly benign conditions are terminated and Primcheck returns to Israel and secures employment in a government architectural agency in Jerusalem, headed by the Russian emigre, Olga Shalansky.  A subsequent association with a Palestinian stonecutter enmeshes Primchek in a network of loyalties and conflicts basic to the overarching political struggle in the region, a struggle begging for resolution.<br /><br />Tensions between the ruling and the ruled are artfully drawn.  In addition to savvy politics, the book's dramatis personae features characters compelling interest and sympathy.  Allahu Akbar's engrossing climax illustrates the perils inherent in US foreign policy, congenital conceits which increasingly risk catastrophe."

Riley has now moved back to her home state of Texas and is desperate to regain the full set of skills needed to be an ER nurse. She doesn't just need to prove herself to her employers and her family; she's desperate to prove to herself that she can do everything she was able to do before the attack. Her associates love the work she does as a chaplain, but Riley doesn't see that role in her future. She and Jack see each other as a means to an end: she can get the practice she needs at his free clinic and he thinks he can use her family name to keep his clinic open and possibly obtain funding for it.<br /><br />It is always a delight to \\""scrub in\\"" with Calvert and her characters.

Cate is thin, disciplined and accomplished, having been recently named the features editor of Gloss magazine, a high end lifestyle publication. However being the editor brings along its own set of complications and new challenges for Cate to overcome.<br /><br />Renee looks at Cate's life with envy. Slightly overweight and definitely underpaid, she will do anything to nab the job as the beauty editor of Gloss, even if that means relying on black market diet pills to shed those few extra pesky pounds. Will Renee gain the job that she's always coveted or will she lose everything that she had in the first place?<br /><br />Shy and quiet Abby is a recent transplant to New York from D.C. Cate and Renee struggle to discover what happened to her there that would have made Abby flee her seemingly happy life as a nanny to a little girl that she adored and a graduate student.<br /><br />These Girls tells the story of these three very different women as they struggle to navigate the path that life has laid out for them, and as they learn to rely on one another for friendship.<br /><br />I must warn you that I'm a bit of a Sarah Pekkanen fangirl, and I just can't help the excitement that comes with reading one of her latest novels. In fact she is one of the authors whose books have made it onto my permanent bookshelves. I was thrilled when These Girls arrived in the mail, and I was certainly not disappointed when I read it.<br /><br />The ultimate theme of These Girls is the exploration of female friendships and how they work. As a woman for whom female friendships have not always come easily (although I am blessed with the friendship of a group of great women now, it did take a while for these friendships to form) I appreciated the fact that these three very different women did not instantly share a bond. I get tired of reading books where the friends who the plot is formed around have always been best friends and have been through everything together and who just happen to still be best friends into adulthood. The friendship that emerges between Cate, Renee, and Abby is earned, little by little, piece by piece. In fact in the beginning of the book Cate laments that it is not easy for her to relax and open up to the far more friendly character of Renee. Pekkanen's observations about women and how they interact with one another as they navigate their thirties were spot on.<br /><br />Although These Girls explores the theme of friendship, it also explores each woman's individual story in depth. Although I enjoyed both Cate and Abby's stories, I found myself relating the most to Renee, the slightly overweight, eager-to-please nice girl. Renee is that typical woman who finds herself so anxious to be liked by those around her that she finds it irrelevant if she actually likes herself. When Renee receives nasty comments on her blog regarding her weight something inside of her snaps and she decides to do anything to lose weight, even if that means ordering black market diet pills off of the Internet. While the pills have their intended result, the changes in her behavior threaten to alienate all those around her. I think that most women will find something about Renee that they were able to relate to, whether that be her insecurities or her desire to please people at her own expense.<br /><br />These Girls is an engaging story about three very different women and the bonds that form between them as they discover what adulthood has in store for them.

The whole point of the book is that it's OKAY and NORMAL to feel all of these different emotions, and they are all part of all of us!"
413,1600608833,5,"Who can resist a pink cat, a purple-haired heroine and a villainess with many faces?  Not me!  I could hardly put CAT GIRL'S DAY OFF down and am hoping for a sequel.<br /><br />Kimberly Pauley has written a wicked fun book that kids as well as adults will enjoy. The dialogue is rich with humor, the cast of characters offers great personalities and diversity, and the cat conversations are hilarious. Love those talking cats!<br /><br />And aside from feline fun, there's a kidnapping mystery with lots of twists and turns and thrills. Natalie is a likeable heroine with insecurities that teens can relate to, as well as a tough determined side that pushes her into action to save cats and humans. Her friends, Melly and Oscar, are great, too. And the cat characters are total scene stealers -- I loved their kick-tail attitude.<br /><br />Congratulations Kimberly and Tu Books for creating an amazing catastic book! I can't wait to read more!"
414,193627731X,5,"I've started reading the book, and I love it. I'd read two or three books for children before, but nothing to do with this. It's wonderful. My son, Danel, is 40 months old. He already knew the name of the pieces, but I didn't know how to continue teaching him. He is very nervous and it's difficoult for him to concentrate. I find very very important, specially for him, learning chess. Today I've started teaching him with the help of your book. We've starte with Chapter 4. I was very happy, because he could do all the games and exercises. I tried to continue with the rook, and, incredibly, he was very concentrated, and happy, and he wanted more and more. We only did 2-3 exercises of the Rook, but he could move them perfectly and we played some of the games. I couldn't believe. He said that he wanted to play another day. I'll tell you how it's going.<br />It's really worth buying it.<br />Regards from Spain"
415,0785161775,4,"Collecting: Astonishing X-Men #44-47<br />Astonishing X-Men: Ghost Boxes #1<br /><br />The issues collected here create an alternate universe to test both what an evil Xavier would be like but also to test how much leading a mutant army has hardened Scott.  Fortunately, the multiverse is relatively easy to access with devices called Ghost Boxes.<br /><br /> Ghost boxes are devices that allow characters to enter into a different timeline, a parallel universe, where events don't transpire like they do in the mainstream universe that marvel characters usually occupy. In the timeline featured here, the X-Men have waged war on Magneto to free the subjugated human race. In his dying breath, Magneto cracks the planet causing certain doom. Xavier, recast as Savior in this timeline, and other smart mutants create a device to save their planet, but it is fueled by Cyclops.<br /><br />The evil Xavier scours the multiverse collecting various incarnations of Cyclops and using them until they burn out until he finds our Cyclops (the mainstream, \\""real\\"" Cyclops). Our Cyclops is too pragmatic too battle hardened to fall for the old \\""sacrifice yourself to save billions of innocent people\\"" routine, right?<br /><br />Exalted's plot is a little weak, and as is necessary when one hops out of our timeline, really does nothing for the Astonishing X-Men title as a whole. But there are a few saving graces:<br /><br />1. The testing of Scott's character IS interesting (even if the vehicle it was delivered in was ponderous).<br /><br />2. The artwork. Mike McKone does a good job overall. And readers are treated to an especially skillful rendering of a mohawk wearing alternate earth Storm.<br /><br />Overall, I like what was done with Scott's character. I loved the ending scene. However I was quickly tired of yet another alternate earth."
416,1451659865,5,"There are people you learn a little from, and there are people you learn a lot from. For me, Beth Vogt is in the second category.<br /><br />When I was just starting out in fiction writing a few years ago, Beth graciously volunteered her time to teach a handful of newbies how to critique one another. Month after month, she guided us, instructed us, and encouraged us, until we were ready to continue on our own. That group is still together.<br /><br />During one of those sessions, Beth brought the first chapter of her novel, Wish You Were Here. I loved the story, and couldn't wait for her to get published so I could read the rest of the story.<br /><br />That day finally arrived when I received the book in the mail a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, I had to fight my husband over the book, since we were both reading it at the same time. Now my mom is visiting, and she's spending all her time with her nose in the book.<br /><br />Wish You Were Here is an inspirational novel set in my neck of the woods--Colorado. It was really fun to read about places I've been (my town even makes it into the book!) and new places I'd like to explore. And it has llamas!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. Allison is a character readers can relate to. Her issues are not skin-deep, and I loved discovering her layers right along with her. Both her character arc and Daniel's are so realistic, and the dialogue keeps things moving along in a humorous way.<br /><br />One of the things Beth does best is keeping the reader off balance with plot twists. Romances are usually so predictable. Not this one. My husband was so worried about how it would end, right up until the last chapter with its wholly satisfying ending."

Hellfire club wants to make sure that no school that teaches peace gets in the way of selling hate.<br /><br />There are a lot of great things happening in these first four issues that are spoiled by Saturday morning cartoon styled artwork. These issues set up Wolverine's school very much in the original spirit of the original Xavier's school. There are classes, detention, teenage mischief, dating and crushes, and high stakes life and death battles for the future of the world.<br /><br />Wolverine & the X-Men seems set up to work like the New Mutants series: young, superhero action without too much of the grim baggage that sometimes comes with being an X-Man. Wolverine & the X-Men sets up some great plot threads that will be fun to follow: Bobby's tapping his potential, but how deep can that go? Warren thinks he actually is an angel! And two of the students are mini-versions of the X-Men's worst enemies, the Brood and Apocalypse. And of course a lawsuit against the Hellfire club is going to draw some superhero conflict soon.<br /><br />So what went wrong?<br /><br />All the things that were going right in this series were hard to see because of the corny artwork provided by Chris Bachalo. The characters proportions are off. They are awkwardly outlined. The faces are flat and almost featureless. The X-Mansion... Wolverine is old, he loves Japan--this school looks like it fell out of the Jetsons.<br /><br />Overall I found this graphic novel served well as a \\""back to school\\"" episode. I am interested in some of the characters that will be developed in this series. Wolverine & the X-Men is treading a fine line between approachable to new readers and juvenile. The back to school plot coupled with the cartoonish art pushes this graphic novel into the juvenile category. I have hopes that the series will improve in subsequent issues.quent issues."

This book cranks it up a notch and then magically puts it all in perspective \\""attuning us to the presence of the Divine within us...\\"".  I quote it often in my spiritual development classes.  One thing is sure...This is not an ordinary manuscript!

I could never get into a good groove -- I didn't like the examples/samples, the way the concepts were being introduced wasn't intuitive.  The book just wasn't for me.  A few months later, I decided to try again.  Since iOS 5 was out, I needed a new book.  I saw a number of positive reviews for the BNR book and decided to give it a try.  I immediately enjoyed the book and found myself much more engaged.  The pace is good, the examples are interesting and they do a great job of introducing key concepts.  I really appreciate the fact that in a short amount of time, not only am I learning more about the iOS foundation, but I'm also exploring the use of key features, like location and maps.  Even though I used to write a lot of code, I don't feel this book is too dumbed down.  I really feel this book has accelerated my learning curve of iOS."

422,B000HUMYO8,5,"Like the Betty Crocker \\""Dinner for Two\\"" cookbook published in the same era, this is a classic cookbook with receipes designed for culinary pleasure rather than health. As the other reviewer said, this book was published before the time of gas and electric grills but the recipies are good no matter how they're cooked.<br /><br />This is not a book for those who are seekers of traditional southern pork or western beef barbeque which require subtle rubs and/or sauces. This is for the person who likes to cook hamburgers and hot dogs on a simple backyard grill. It also provides, and I think this is it's greatest feature, outstanding side-dish receipes for such things as potato salad, coleslaw and beans. The \\""cabbage-pepper slaw\\"" is the best slaw I've ever eaten as is the receipe for \\""perfect potato salad.\\""<br /><br />The book takes a stab at ribs but it never gets around to Texas-style brisquet or Southern pulled pork. Oh, it has a brisquet receipe and it has some pork receipes but they really don't capture any of the distinctiveness of those classical barbeque styles. Still, for the side dishes as well as the burger and hot dog recipies, it's well worth the price.<br /><br />One final note: The cover on this edition is very different from the one on my first edition published in 1956. It is possible that changes have been made in the later edition which might overcome some of the shortcomings I've mentioned."

It is the story of life in a post-apocalyptic future where the red lung virus has destroyed the world as we know it and created \\""Rabids\\"" who roam the earth blindly hunting and killing humans. The vampires that are left create vampire cities and humans are kept as blood donors and servants but nothing more. Allie is a human flying under the radar in the sewers and tunnels hiding from the vampire ruler and his minions scrounging for food and shelter with a gang of like-minded misfits. Out on a scavenger hunt one night, every one is killed excepted for Allie who is fatally wounded. She is given a choice by a rogue vampire and decides to join the legions of the undead and become that which she loathes - a vampire. Now this is where it really gets interesting as Allie is conflicted with feeling human and not having a heartbeat. She yearns for her old life and to have friends and security but struggles with being a monster who has to survive on blood. Her creator Kanin is something of a mystery and has his share of secrets. I won't spoil it for the rest but lets just say there is a sweet love story mixed with redemption and the outcome will surprise you. Plenty of action and fight scenes and moments of despair laced with hope that Eden is out there. Will Allie make the right choice or will she succumb to the monster within? Can't wait to read more on this series."

430,1595554246,1,"I have never left a review of any of the books I have bought from Amazon, but was compelled to comment on this one. Before anyone reading becomes defensive of my review I will start by saying I bought this book because it sounded like a very inspiring story. What I found however, was the poorly written rantings of an egotist. I can not believe that this book has even one good review, let alone nine. The story is all over the place. One minute we are in the Sudan the next we are back in the US. Did anyone edit this rag? I particularly enjoyed those anecdotes about Childers' encounters with the LRA guerrillas. These same individuals who are war hardened, desensitized to death and dying, and have committed unspeakable acts of violence on their fellow humans, are struck with fear when Childers comes around. He must be a very intimidating person.<br />  I read about forty pages before I had to do a little digging on Childers. Sam Childers, even after some cursory investigation is at best a liar, at worst a murderer. I understand Christians embracing Childers because he never fails to remind the reader how often God speaks to him, but I am at a loss to understand how anyone reading this book doesn't come away with the perspective that Childers, while an expert on self-promotion, is nothing more than a sad, arrogant, braggart with Daddy issues and a serious Napoleonic Complex. Why do I have to read page after page of him beating up the biggest, baddest guy in town with two punches? Or when he was a teenager, that he was so irresistible to all the adult women in the neighborhood, they all just HAD to have sex with him? Has anyone seen a picture of this guy? He is always the shortest dude in the photo.<br />  Childers revealed something interesting when he told his family he was going to the Sudan to help construction projects. \\""... by that time, I'd been springing African schemes on them for years.\\"" (pg22) The use of the word \\""schemes\\"" is an interesting choice. He says on the one hand God called him unexpectedly to the Sudan but reveals he had been thinking about it for years.<br />  It is obvious he has spent a great deal of time in the Sudan but it is hard to believe it has been in the capacity he has claimed. I think at best he does the average missionary work and then takes a bunch of pictures with the locals with guns in his hand to make the people back home think he is really fighting. I can not find any article or eyewitness account of anyone (other than Childers himself) actually seeing Childers in a combat situation. I think before anyone gives money to this guy's \\""mission\\"" they should really look deeper. Christianity Today reported in September of 2011 that an American doctor visited Childers' orphanage in July of 2009 and reported he \\""...saw one child after another with fever over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, ruptured eardrums, fungus-infected heads, protruding bellies, and infected lacerations. ... I am at a loss for words as to the suffering of these children.\\"" In a letter dated October 2010 Lt. Gen. Kuol Deim Koul official spokesman of the SPLA, released a letter saying that Childers is NOT associated with their organization. And even if Childers were associated with them, his credibility as a savior of the Sudanese children comes into question. According to a 2004 report issued by the Coalition to Stop Child Soldiers the SPLA themselves had in their ranks between 2,500 to 5,000 children.<br />  Anyone who has been associated with drug users will know that they are the most selfish, self-absorbed people walking. In this book, he claims he only fought for people who could not fight for himself. In an April 27 2010 Vanity Fair article, Childers is remembered very differently by people who knew him growing up. They remember him more for fighting for no reason at all. One man even remembers Childers demanding to have sex with the his girlfriend and saying that Childers only went away when the man gave him all of his drugs. That same Vanity Fair article reports of a stockpile of weapons that Childers KEEPS IN THE ORPHANAGE!!! The article goes on to say he sells the weapons from this location to SPLA.<br />  I lived in the deep South, around Mobile Alabama for a lot of years and if there is one thing I learned about Christians is they will lie through their teeth if that will get you into their church and give your hard earned money. Childers is no different. Like that idiot preacher in Florida who burned the Koran to shine a spotlight on his insignificant little church, Childers is the same. So many people have bought into it because it reads like a Hollywood script. But that is all it is. A story concocted by an opportunistic nut who is only whoring out images of poor suffering children to line his bank account. Its sounds like he is nothing but a petty arms dealer in the middle of a conflict. I think he saw this during his missionary work early on that he could make a buck down in Africa selling illegal Russian weapons to the SPLA then when the media comes he plays it up like he is fighting with them. I know times are hard and we are all looking for heroes but Sam Childers is not one of them."

439,0449149900,5,"Although I loved the Blue Rose series and The Hellfire Club, my favorite works by Straub are those that focus on paranormal plot lines, like Ghost Story, Shadowland (my favorite!) and Floating Dragon. When I picked up Mr. X, I was delighted to find that Straub had returned to his paranormal past.<br /><br />The story was fresh and the writing tight and captivating. The plot itself was highly original, and the working in of Lovecraft was brilliant. I hadn't read \\""The Dunwich Horror,\\"" and when I realized how integral it was to Mr. X, I set down the book and picked up my Lovecraft anthology. Something a bit spooky happened -- I set down Mr. X at page 89, and \\""The Dunwich Horror\\"" began on page 89 of the Lovecraft anthology! Of course, this has nothing to do with anything, but I found it amusing nonetheless. I'm glad I read the Lovecraft story, as it gave a great many hints to the inner workings of Mr. X. If you haven't read \\""The Dunwich Horror,\\"" it's advisable to do so before beginning Mr. X.<br /><br />After reading the other reviews, I wondered if the negative reviewers had read the same book. Straub left no questions unanswered -- perhaps those reviewers just didn't understand what happened? Mr. X was perfectly characterized, and his diary was consistent with his mental state. Ned was my favorite kind of character: flawed, but likeable, as were most of the characters in the book (with the exception, of course, of Mr. X).<br /><br />My only real criticism is that Straub isn't particularly good at writing women, a flaw that's consistent throughout his writing. His women are either kooky, whore-ish or angelic -- although the \\""angel\\"" in this story is a little more rounded than the \\""angels\\"" in his other books. The various female family members were nicely written, though.<br /><br />Straub didn't write in a single event that wasn't necessary to the story. Every loose end was wrapped up, and every character and scene essential to the plot. The various mystery elements were revealed at exactly the right time and place, and although some things were easy to guess for Lovecraft readers, there were enough surprises to satisfy me, and I'm an extremely critical reader of mysteries and crime fiction.<br /><br />To sum up my review, if you love Straub, you'll love this book. Happy reading!revealed at exactly the right time and place, and although some things were easy to guess for Lovecraft readers, there were enough surprises to satisfy me, and I'm an extremely critical reader of mysteries and crime fiction.<br /><br />To sum up my review, if you love Straub, you'll love this book.

The novel's fantasy world holds the potential for unexpected, monstrous perils and magical, heroic rescues. Sandy Nathan never fails to surprise with plot twists and character transformations.

And, if I can identify with the problem, then I should be able to identify with the solution too.  The book talks about one persons experience (the founder) and in the back there are other personal stories.  Between the two area very useful bits of information about symptoms, withdrawal (yes, there is a withdrawal, just like from a drug), relationships, after sobriety, and more.

If same sex couples raising children isn't something you believe in, and you don't want to open your mind then pass on this book.  For the rest of you out there this was a touching a sweet story of Zach Wahls and his two mothers.<br /><br />Wahls was on the Daily show, which originally got me interested in reading his book.  He seemed extremely confidant, successful and more importantly happy; which is what any parent strives (or should strive) for their child to be. This is not his first time speaking on the issue of gay parenting, last year he added a new voice to the issue, one of the child in question being raised.  He was so verbally eloquent that a book was a logical next step.<br /><br />The book focuses on the different ideals he learned as an Eagle Scout, and how they are/were applied to his childhood and family.  It was an interesting way to discuss gay parenting, by using the ideals of the traditional `American Ideal', a boy scout.  I think it also proves that in America there are many ways to describe family, and not every family who is `different' is broken.<br /><br />The book is easily read and contains many lessons as well as wisdom in dealing with adversity.  While this book may not appeal to everyone, I feel like each person should pick up this or a similar story to really get the perspective from the people that gay parenting actually affects... the child/ren in question."

449,0965327523,5,Bought this for a bridal shower gift...the bride LOVED it and I heard the groom was very interested as well because of the photographs. Great find overall.
450,0615248241,5,Baje's Book was very insightful and taught me a lot. She shared stuff the average woman don't know (espcially Mom). I wish I had read this book when I was younger (teens and twenties) because young girls are so easily impressed by manipulative men. Her insight probably would have helped me to be a more confident as a young woman and prevented me from getting into a uncomfortable situations. I definitely recommend this book to ALL women especially young ladies just to have a different perspective on life and dating. Thanks Baje
451,0805093931,3,"Author Paul Harper (David Lindsey writing under a pseudonym for a very specific and lengthy narrative project) introduces another moody and emotionally unsettled protagonist in Pacific Heights, the first installment in what is promised to be a long, multi-part novel. It remains to be seen whether this series will become an integrated long novel (think of Proust) or just a series of exercises in which the same characters meander through different but slightly connected storylines (think of Allen Drury's Washington insider novels of 40 years ago). On the evidence of this first book-length component, lead character Marten Fane is possibly interesting and complex enough to be worth following for the long haul. But there has got to be some serious character development in future installments, because the Fane in this novel is a little vague; he is definitely capable of unforeseen excursions into unanticipated behavior. And while I am willing to give Lindsey a chance to develop his complex story, this first installment by itself is a little less under control than I would have expected from Lindsey.<br /><br />I give Lindsey credit for undertaking such an effort, and I will stick with him for at least the first two or three installments to see if it looks like he can bring it off. But if the long arc of the entire tale remains foggy or unclear after three installments, I'm not sure I will hang around for the rest.<br /><br />Lindsey has already proven in earlier novels that he is meticulous in crafting tales in which all the characters -- good, bad, temporary or secondary participants in the action -- have complex natures and face a variety of psychological burdens and challenges. Somewhere at the heart of this first installment in the Marten Fane series is a potentially interesting concept -- can an assassin with good skills in understanding human psychology actually drive a target to commit suicide? -- but the development and realization of this concept strike me as superficial and incomplete. The would-be assassin, whose name is uncertain for many pages but whose initials are RK, has numerous moments in which he is perplexed by the fact that an expected outcome is not happening; for a presumed expert in security and intelligence work he seems to be a little slow to understand the possibility that other security and intelligence experts may have a line on him. Still, the dialog is often riveting for pages at a time, and the details of intelligence development and black bag operations have a certain ring of authenticity to them. That's not to say that they really are authentic, but just that they don't come across as risibly improbable. This is an example of decent genre fiction, bearing in the mind the proviso that as the storyline develops we may find we are not in the genre we think we are in.<br /><br />At the end of this novel the hook is set for Fane's activities in future installments, with the road left open not only for his own investigative projects but also for those that may be connected to the interests of a much larger security firm with powerful but out-of-sight national and international clients.<br /><br />Not a bad effort; just not stellar, given one's expectations of Lindsey. The next two or three installments will probably determine the fate of the overall effort.<br /><br />I suspect this is one series that will need to be read in order of composition to get the full effect of the author's design."

458,1118027450,5,"I've been to Las Vegas twice in the last three years. There's more to the city than just gambling. Actually I tell people if you're going to Vegas, it's not the money that you'll lose but the gastronomical delight in the city itself.<br /><br />Top Chef did a season in Las Vegas which won the Emmy Award for that season. Food is everywhere in Las Vegas. It has some of the top dining spots in the world with the top master chefs like Rick Moonen, Tom Colicchio, Susan Feniger, Emeril Lagasse, Wolfgang Puck, and host of other known chefs have opened restaurants here.<br /><br />There are plenty of restaurants for the all-star dining experience to the Pink's hot dog stand at Planet Hollywood. This book makes me want to go back to the city of sparkling and dazzling lights where snippets of Rome, Venice, Paris, and even New York City have a spot here.<br /><br />This book is a colorful first class guide with plenty of pages to inform the readers about the restaurants, hotels, and casinos of course along with shows in season. Unlike Broadway, many performers in Sin City perform about 3 or 4 performances a week. If you want to see Celine Dion, be sure to check her schedule before you make any plans.<br /><br />By the way, Caesars Colosseum has tighter security than any airport and you're better off leaving your camera in your hotel room as I learned when I saw Bette Midler in 2009. Luckily, my room was at Caesars. In fact, my room there featured a bidet in the bathroom. Caesars is a first rate hotel in the center of all the action. It easily leads to the Forum Shopping Mall with a unique escalator.<br /><br />When you visit Las Vegas, please don't expect your flip flops to count as quality walking shoes. Believe me, you will be walking here all over the place. MGM Grand Casino is unbelievably large and we saw the pilot of \\""Mike and Molly\\"" at CBS Studios where they offer free viewings. It was worth it even though I felt like I walked a mile to get there in the casino.<br /><br />Walking in Las Vegas is a must at times but each casino is air-conditioned and you should stop and see the sights other than the casino floor. The first time in Las Vegas, we stayed in and around Caesars. We did get to see the Liberace Museum before it closed. The Liberace Museum is worth seeing if it comes back because all the proceeds benefit his foundation for musical students. It's a worthy cause and we were lucky to get a shuttle bus from the Flamingo to and from the Museum at the time.<br /><br />We stayed at the Flamingo the second time because we got comped three out of four nights per Total Rewards which also provides discounts to Caesars and Paris. Flamingo is a large hotel with a great pool shaded by the palm trees. Both Flamingo and Caesars pools were less than four feet deep and most don't go swimming as much as just lounge around poolside.<br /><br />If you can get to Las Vegas, you should use this book whether for a weekend or a longer getaway even with the kids in tow. Las Vegas can still be a family vacation with side trips to the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon and Red Rock Canyon as well./>Walking in Las Vegas is a must at times but each casino is air-conditioned and you should stop and see the sights other than the casino floor.

460,0375726276,1,"This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read. For the most part Kaplan just rants about how great Churchill was and how evil Hitler and the Nazis were....which right off the bat defecates all over the plot of this book since the Nazis were Pagans (who claimed to be xians to the public). Secondly he never actually explains why leadership demands a Pagan ethos, the closest thing to explaining that is how sometimes he takes a break from talking about Churchill to say \\""This guy (who's not even Pagan) espouses some Pagan 'ethos' (never explains how that's a Pagan trait) and he was a great leader.\\"" but I think such an organized comparison only happened twice in this book. Don't buy this book, lighting a grill with money instead of charcoal would be a more responsible way of using your money.<br /><br />This book is so awful that non-Pagans will quote it to say why Pagans should not be leaders."

479,0345803485,1,"I am a lover of books.  I love to read and try to as often as possible.  I like many others, I'm sure, bought these books because it was compared to the Twilight books.  This book is so NOT a Twilight book.  Ok, I admit I didn't read the reviews of previous readers but I did read the blurb on the back of the books and some of the recommendations online.  At this moment in time I am a little over half way through the first book (I would be further along if I didn't have to stop and look up what half the \\""punishments\\"" in this book are).  One thing I can tell you at this point is The Twilight Saga and The Fifty Shades Trilogy are nothing alike, they don't even belong in the same universe.  The Twilight Saga was a  Young Adults series, that had the added bonus of being appealing to adults.  Twilight had a virgin that waited until marriage, (4th book) to have sex (even though she was only 18) ...Fifty shades goes all of about two days.  The Fifty Shades Trilogy doesn't belong in the same house as anyone who would be considered a YOUNG ADULT.  I heard there was a romantic novel about a handsome, mysterious man and his deep dark secret.  I assumed secret agent, bounty hunter, vampire...not secret sex room!  This book is not my first romance novel.  I'll admit it I am a sucker for a good romance novel every now and again, but this book is SO NOT what I was looking for or wanted to find.  The difference between this novel and other romance novels is...THERE'S NO ROMANCE.  Most romance novels have a a romantic story line, some hardship or dilemma that has to be overcome for love to win, with a sprinkle, perhaps a dash of sex.  However, Fifty Shades reads more like a really graphic and detailed script to a really bad, low budget PORNO. I am not sure if I will bother finishing the first book or read the second and third, if the first 250 pages is an indication of whats in store I highly doubt I will finish it.<br /><br />I also have to point out that the books are deceptive inappearance.  The covers only add to the belief that they are similiar to the Twilight novels...look at the covers!! These covers are specifically designed to grab the attention of Twilight fans...I unfortunately bought into it.  After the first 100 pages I shut the book and examined the cover, and wow there is a warning \\""Exotic Romance/Mature Audience\\""...but it is unlikely that anyone purchasing these books would see this warning unless specifically looking for it. The only thing that is probably worse than the plot, content and dialogue of this book is that some YOUNG ADULT, a fan of Twilight or similiar book, will purchase this book and actually read it."

Many of the definitions are always on point for me, for instance I have a recurring dream of guns often.  Its definition is that it means some injustice will occur following that dream.  This is 100% true.  The same with dreams I have about smoke, or if I see cats in my dreams.  Very few times have the book been off for me.  I've tried others, and have gone to one of the major dream sites but don't find the same bit of accuracy as this book.<br /><br />My only wish is that somehow the book can be updated, but it would have to be done by a scholar equally as gifted as the original people who wrote this book.

485,080079527X,5,"I just recently read Bill and Randy's other book, The Essential Guide to Healing, and had found out about this one when looking for new books to get on my Kindle app and pre-ordered it. I just read the entire thing in one sitting! As a commenter on another review already stated, Unplugged is not intended to be a teaching book that expounds on theology behind healing ministry, but rather is written in a conversational style between these two good friends and co-laborers. (If you are looking for a more teaching-type resource, I do recommend getting The Essential Guide to Healing.) They each ask each other the same basic series of questions, beginning with how each got started in healing ministry, how they have grown in it, and giving testimonies of some of the miracles they have witnessed.<br /><br />What I most enjoyed about the book was reading each man's personal insights and experiences as they have learned things in their years of ministering both with their own churches and ministries, as well as times they have ministered together. I feel that I have personally learned new things about how to pray for people to be healed from reading from Bill and Randy's successes and struggles alike. I also enjoyed the glimpse into the friendship between Bill and Randy and seeing how much they honor and respect each other, as well as how they have learned from one another over the year. One reason I believe that they are leaders and fathers of the Christian faith in this generation is because of their willingness to work alongside and learn from one another.<br /><br />If you are looking for more of a personal, intimate chat on the subject of healing, then this is the book for you. If you want more teaching, Scripture referencing, and theology, then I recommend their other book I mentioned before."

488,1595549153,5,"I loved this title and almost read the entire novel in a few hours one night.<br /><br />The characters are believable and the setting is described well enough to paint a picture of their environment.  I really do NOT envy the women who lived in the wild frontier with potential threats just around the corner.  I would most definitely be like Lucy as she screamed at the site of a `pet' tarantula in her new home and would want my husband to clear the place of all spiders and cobwebs, too.<br /><br />There are two themes throughout the novel which really resonated with me.  The first is Lucy's desire to be the helpmeet God wants for her husband.  The second is the difficulty Lucy has with not controlling everything around her and earning respect and love from others.  Ms. Coble did a fantastic job weaving those themes throughout and allows for further contemplation through discussion questions at the end of the book.<br /><br />Above taken from my review originally published on Day by Day in Our World."

490,1884519016,5,"I bought the book earlier this afternoon, and just finished it. While it is rather short (about 120 pages), I think it's a worthwhile purchase for a few different reasons.<br />  One: The title of my review says it all- some fresh perspective on Howard Zinn! Zinn is discussed at length; primarily dealing with theoretical interpretations of how he would've approached the Occupy movement. Of course, Zinn isn't here to explain himself, but Chomsky does an admirable job of trying to relate Zinn and 'Occupy'. Agree or disagree with Chomsky; the fact is that you still are getting a fresh approach on one of the most beloved historians of our time.<br />  Two: Chomsky can come across as a simple and boring read. This is mainly due to the fact that his written works are usually transcripts of prior speeches that he's made. Therefore, he repeats certain points numerous times, and his overall argument can seem disjointed or a bit sloppily put together. My advice is to read him as if he is speaking in front of you. This works great sometimes, and other times it is still a chore to get to his overall argument, but once you do, the argument is almost always compelling.<br />  Having said that, he still delivers a relevant argument for the need of 'Occupy' and movements similar to it. I think most people interested in the book are going to be familiar with his politics, and those of the larger movement. And this is only the first of a series examining the  Occupy movement, and all are printed by Zuccotti Park Press. So if you are looking for a way to support the movement and show Solidarity, then I highly recommend that you read this book!"

492,1594203334,1,"As other reviewers have said, this book capitalizes on the fact that it may be selling you the secret to bringing up perfect kids. Naturally, as a new parent I was intrigued and somewhat taken in by the promise of being able to get my baby to sleep through the night. If you've read the book, you'll know that there's no help in that area whatsoever. Furthermore, the idea that French parents just tell their babies to sleep through the night, expect it to happen and - voila! - it does, is just nonsense.<br /><br />I put this book down when the author described how a friend came to visit and miraculously cured her child from pulling books off the bookshelf onto the floor. The friend stopped the child and explained \\""no, we don't do that\\"" and showed the child how to put them back. Honestly, if you need someone to tell you that as a parent, as the author did, then yes, maybe this book is for you. But for heaven's sake, where's the author's common sense?<br /><br />My parents live in France. I have spent many years there and I can tell you from my observations, the French do not hold the key to bringing up well behaved children. If any of them do, it's just plain common sense, which some people in other countries have too!"

I was expecting something with lots of detail on different types of canine massage, products to make or buy to indulge my dog-children with, things like that.

If I had seen the book, I would not have purchased it. I'm just glad that I didn't pay any more for it than I did."
494,1451648537,3,"Not one for half measures, Jobs wanted Einstein's biographer to write his life.  I think Isaacson couldn't resist the access, but should have held off on publication.  Its too soon to form an opinion on Jobs impact.  The  boom, bust, boom again story is not played out yet.  Apple, the company, could take over the planet, or fade like Sony or something in between;  Mobile computing and digitization of media experiences have definitely been popularized by Steve Jobs, but where will it go now?  Too soon to tell, I think.<br />The tale is well told, Jobs characters flaws - volatile,obsessive, inspiring - are unvarnished.  The comments from his family seem very realistic,  its not quite said, but it seems to me he was very tight with money.  Isaascson's direct observations of Jobs are mostly acute, but sometimes banal - or is he mocking us when he describes what music Jobs had on his iPod? The comments of non-family members in the book seem to me to be, to varying degrees self-serving, basking in some kind of reflected glory.  I saw a Charlie Rose interview with Eric Schmidt in the days following Jobs death, and even I could tell that it was puke-inducing pap.  A lot of Job's colleagues  anecdotes in the book have the same feel.<br />I got the book for Christmas, and I was reading it as the new Korean dictator - son of the former Korean dictator - was being presented to the people.  He seemed a bit overwhelmed.  I felt that Tim Cook's role is a bit similar, how do you follow in the footsteps of someone whose whim's became decisions, and whose whims changed in a heart-beat?  The book contains  many stories about designs having to be completely changed when Jobs, usually at the eleventh hour, says something along the lines of `I'm sorry, I just don't love it'.<br />I read the book primarily to get some detail on the pricing decisions behind iTunes, a truly remarkably audacious piece of marketing I think - how do you price a product, that is being given away free (if illegally)?  However I didn't find much beyond anecdote about this, and much in a similar vein with other business decisions.<br />Overall an interesting read, but it's possible that ten years from now we will have the same feeling about Jobs as we do now about Princess Diana.  Overall, I think this book will feel very dated in five/ten  years time."
495,1463749554,5,"This book cleverly avoids the cliched medical biography, the deep, dark tale of the blurry region in the medical images, but the flailing doctors, and the soulful and humane response of the family. Instead, we have the midlife crises piled up on top of each other, truly becoming a horror tale, and there's only one path through: deep laughter. This is a better tale than the self-published status might indicate. Tightly written, did I mention funny?, and moving at a breakneck speed.<br /><br />I found it to be a quick read, on a pair of airplane flights in fact, but a story that did stick with me. It's not hard to see yourself in a similar situation."

The stories have multiple interconnecting themes such as forgiveness, second chances, holiday tales, earth/nature and many others that allow everyone to grow and think on issues relevant in our modern world.  Discussion questions at the end of each story lend themselves to parents and educators helping students explore the deeper meanings within.  While not a picture book per say, families will delight at the use of many fun and personable characters, from Sekhar the remorseful lion, Josie the fort building little girl, Max the Meercat, Princess the guinea pig, and many more, with an accompanying beautiful watercolor illustration by Lisa Hedicker (approximately one illustration per story).

502,144240907X,3,"Wither by Lauren Destefano was a great book, but It wasn't my favorite. I had a hard time wrapping my head around the ideas of poligmy with the young age of the main characters, not that I was grossed out by it, just hard to be able to relate too. Fever on the other hand still had some risque ideals and situations but I enjoyed the story so much more. Rhine and Gabriel are at a carnival (and I say that very loosely) because its more of a whore house disguised as a carnival.<br /><br />Everyone in this carnival type atmosphere is or seems to be drugged and that made the feel of this book very trippy, which was interesting to say the least. The start of the book for me seemed a big slow and I had to adjust to this new world they were thrown into especially because it was so different from the setting/world they were in in the first book.<br /><br />I felt this book was a lot more fast-paced then the first and for that I loved the book, and of course the book ends on a nasty cliffhanger and I can't wait to see what world and scenerio the third book brings Rhine and Gabirel and if they ever find the infamous Rowan. Lauren Destefano has a writing style like no other young adult author I have ever read, and I honestly can't think of adult author that has a similar style either. She is very descriptive but in a way that isn't overkill, usually I hate overly descriptive writing styles, but Lauren does it in a way that is captivating instead of mundanel.

504,1932815465,3,"Tolteca by K. Michael Wright is rich with imagery, some poetic prose and memorable characters.  Topiltzin is a prince who leaves his father's kingdom to play the rubberball game in the south. The south has changed because of a bloodthirsty prophet warrior named Smoking Mirror. Instead of a game, Topiltzin and his teammates find unbelievable atrocities in the southern villages. Being a prince, he must respond.<br /><br />This is the story of the conflicts between Topilzin, Smoking Mirror and many others around the area that is now Mexico City in the years 421 to 576 AD. It is both sympathetic and very gory. It provides a motive to the atrocities and sacrifices that some believe took place during this time.<br /><br />While not a fantasy, it is written from a point of view that allows that the fantastic might happen.

But his last outrage has her turning in her notice of resignation, and from that point onwards, things only seem to get better. However, for the eternally lucky Damon Torrance, that is the start of his descent for everything to go wrong. He soon causes scandal and is put on leave by his own father.  Things get worse when his wallet gets stolen and he finds has no place to live!  Damon realizes he has to get Natasha back.  But what he doesn't know is that what he really wants is her love.<br /><br />This story is laugh out loud funny and totally implausible.  Before Natasha, Damon slept with all of his assistants, but Natasha was married -so hands off!  Natasha gets a divorce soon after and hides it from Damon for years.  How is that possible that he not know?  Also Natasha has an eight year old child. How could Damon miss that she was pregnant and had a child after knowing her and working with her all these years?  Wouldn't he realize she was on maternity leave?  But these facts seem to blow by because the story is so darn funny and outrageous. The antics Damon gets into and the unpredictability of the storyline make it very amusing.<br /><br />Entertaining and tons of laughs -this book defies logic but still makes you keep reading it for the sheer hilarity and mind-boggling craziness of the plot and outrageous one liners.<br /><br />Reviewed by Steph from the Bookaholics Romance Book Club"

508,0983740526,5,"One of the ways that I know I've gotten into a good piece of music is the synchronicity that is experienced while listening.

Did the music make this happen?  Did you?

513,0886779146,2,"This book was painful to finish. Nothing in here is scary. A few are creepy. There are some really good stories, but the vast majority are utterly forgettable.<br /><br />\\""Sweets to the Sweet\\"" - Robert Bloch<br />This story is completely predictable and not scary in the least. It's like one of those stories you used to read when you were 10 years old in a collection of \\""scary stories\\"". But even back then you wouldn't find it scary. 1/5<br /><br />\\""The Father-Thing\\"" - Phillip K. Dick<br />Decent, but definitely nothing to get excited about. And not scary in the least. Reminiscent of \\""The Body Snatchers\\"". 2/5<br /><br />\\""The Distributor\\"" - Richard Matheson<br />Terrible story. Not well written. Not frightening in the least. This story is completely ridiculous. At this point I'm regretting buying this book. 1/5<br /><br />\\""A Warning to the Curious\\"" - M. R. James<br />Utterly forgettable. I honestly didn't remember any details about this story other than I felt like I had wasted what little time it took to read this. After reviewing the story again for this review I remembered why I hated it so much. It was boring, the ending was terrible, and again, not scary. Now I'm really regretting buying this book. 1/5<br /><br />\\""Opening the Door\\"" - Arthur Machen<br />Another utterly forgettable story. This one was just as bad as the previous one. Boring, terrible ending, not scary. Waste of time. By now I'm ready to throw this book away. 1/5<br /><br />\\""The Colour Out of Space\\"" - H. P. Lovecraft<br />By now I'm ready to throw the book away. I'm glad I didn't. Finally, a truly great story. Lovecraft sets a tone, a creepy one, and keeps you hooked. Great atmosphere. Great story telling. Great ending. All around a great story. 5/5<br /><br />\\""The Inner Room\\"" - Robert Aickman<br />After the great story by H. P. Lovecraft I'm thinking that maybe the book is picking up. WRONG! This was by far the WORST story in the book. I was honestly mad after reading this one. The story builds slowly and then... Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I honestly felt like he was getting to the climax of the story and his editor called and said, \\""Sorry buddy, you gotta submit it NOW.\\"" So he said okay and cleared things up with one paragraph. 0/5<br /><br />\\""Young Goodman Brown\\"" - Nathaniel Hawthorne<br />Great story. Great mood. Interesting characters. Great story telling. Another gem in this pile of garbage. 5/5<br /><br />\\""The Rats in the Walls\\"" - H. P. Lovecraft<br />Another great story from a great story teller. Again, Lovecraft creates a really creepy mood and ends with a bang. 5/5<br /><br />\\""The Dog Park\\"" - Dennis Etchison<br />Terrible, stupid story. Not interesting in the least. Not scary. Complete waste of time. Stupid ending. 1/5<br /><br />\\""The Animal Fair\\"" - Robert Bloch<br />I honestly went in to this story thinking I was going to hate is because another entry by Robert Bloch, \\""Sweets to the Sweet\\"" was terrible. But this story was written about 20 years later and it seems he became a better writer. I was hooked from the get-go on this one. I compulsively read this one and would not take my eyes off the pages until I was done. Great story. Great setting. Great ending (although you'll figure it out before you get there). Still, an excellent story. Not so much scary, but just a great story. 5/5<br /><br />\\""The Pattern\\"" - Ramsey Campbell<br />Boring. This had potential but it wasn't written very well. It didn't hook me and honestly I didn't really care what happened by the time I got to the end. 2/5<br /><br />\\""The Tell-Tale Heart\\"" - Edgar Allan Poe<br />I honestly thought this was a lazy choice by Joyce Carol Oates but oh well, it's a good story even though every one has read it at least once. Good story telling, great effect of making the narrator seem crazy while he's trying to prove he's not. 4/5<br /><br />\\""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\"" - Ambrose Bierce<br />Decent story. I liked it. Didn't love it. I thought it could have been better. However, I do recognize this story was delving into territory previously untouched at the time. 3/5<br /><br />\\""The Human Chair\\"" - Edogawa Rampo<br />Slightly creepy. Not scary like the intro leads you to believe. It's a definite page-turner. I was sucked-in and glued to the pages, however the ending was terrible I thought. Kind of a how do I get out of this one type thing. The story is great but because of the ending I've got to dock it. 3/5<br /><br />All in all, this collection is 2/5. I debated between a 2 and 3, but the bad stories are SO bad that I couldn't give this book a 3 overall no matter how good the good stories are. The bad stories are THAT bad."

The book begins with an interesting biographical chapter, and there is some esoteric academic stuff throughout. But Don's poetry enlivens most of the pages. Don owned a wonderful sense of humor, and he had an almost magical touch with rhyme. He put the two together in ways that delight. How he found time to produce so much verse is, in itself, a wonder.

522,0767927575,5,"Reading Carolyn Jessop's book, Escape, disturbed me as much as reading a holocaust testimony. And what made it so bad was that the abuse, neglect and hatred of that husband toward his family was all done in the name of Jesus Christ.  Grace was mentioned, and they don't know anything about grace.  Grace is unmerited favor, and all the members of that cult were trying to earn grace by their \\""obedience\\"" and \\""submission\\"" to men.<br /><br />The  Mormon religion is a wicked twist on the truth in the Bible, that grace is free and can't be earned.

I applaud her bravery and her perseverance in the face of so much opposition. I hope her book encourages those now trapped in strange religeous bondage that has nothing to do with the true Jesus Christ who died for sinners, and helps them to take that first brave step toward the freedom we are all born to."

The characters were well developed, but few of them had morals, which was the way of the City back then. Think about Tammany Hall and all the corruption the city has seen through 400 years of being a city.

The author included an abbreviated \\""flash\\"" dictionary which was very helpful, because many characters in the book just spoke flash.<br />Great book.  Thanks for writing it, Lyndsey Faye.  Write some more about NYC (although I plan to read your other book, \\""Dust and Shadow.\\"""
524,0806649305,1,"Evangelical Lutheran Worship includes this daily lectionary.  For several years after \\""ELW\\"" was published, we tried using the lectionary in our congregation.  However, we have gone back to the continuous daily lectionary that was included in the Lutheran Book of Worship, and which is also used by the Presbyterian Church USA and the Episcopal Church USA.  This was due to two factors.  First, since the Revised Common Lectionary Daily Readings is a thematic lectionary (tied to the Sunday readings), it features passages taken out of context.  In our experience, most folks (who have minimal Biblical literacy) were simply unable to discern the context and the meaning of a passage, and most of them simply gave up.  Second, many passages' connection with the just-past or coming Sunday's themes seemed tenuous at best; it was difficult to understand why they had been chosen.<br /><br />We tried our best to stick with the program of the Revised Common Lectionary Daily Readings.  However, we have found that returning to the older, continuous daily lectionary has been much more helpful.  Daily Bible readers are better able to immerse themselves into the ongoing stories of Scripture because today's reading begins where yesterday's ended, in the reading from Hebrew Scripture, the Epistle, and the Gospel."
525,0393058522,4,"In the Roaring Nineties Stiglitz set out to reinterpret the economic history of that decade.  To better grasp his analysis, it will be useful to first depict the standard interpretation against which he directed his critique.<br /><br />During the 90's growth reached levels not seen for a generation; the problem of paying the national debt was replaced by the problem of how to spend the mounting surplus; unemployment fell to record lows; the rise in home values was vertiginous; the stock market soared.  The cause of the unprecedented prosperity?  The `New Economy.'  The New Economy, in the view of many experts, had revolutionized the way business was done.  It would usher in technological breakthroughs which could exponentially increase the rate of productivity.  New information systems would allow for better control of inventories, rendering the problem of excessive supply a thing of the past.  The most Pollyannaish stood prepared to ring the death knell of the business cycle.<br /><br />Is Stiglitz going to say that the roar of the nineties was a whole lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing?  It's worse.  Stiglitz starts by recounting the new set of records set in the wake of the nineties--this time nothing to brag about.  The seeds of this major recession that arrived in March 2001, according to Stiglitz, were planted and lavishly nourished a decade earlier during the exuberant 90's.  From the vantage point of the new millennium, it had become evident that something had gone terribly wrong.<br /><br />Stiglitz points to two principal reasons for the failures that occurred during the 90's.  First, he argues that we lost sight of the balanced role of government.  This need for balance is rooted in Stiglitz's belief that, while the `free' market can be an effective engine of growth, it doesn't always produce the right types of things.  If markets tend to generate too much pollution, or not enough jobs, or not enough scientific research, Stiglitz sees it as beingincumbent on the government to use one of its various tools - taxes, regulation, etc. - to steer the economy towards better outcomes.<br /><br />Whereas after the great depression a generally well-balanced and symbiotic relationship between public and private sectors existed, starting with the Regan administration this affair began to sour.  In fact it turned downright hostile.  The conflict arose out of a renewed faith in the efficacy of unfettered free markets, and, by the same token, a growing skepticism of the government's competence, particularly with regard to all things economic.<br />Second, Stiglitz argues that most of the growth during the 90's was illusory.  The \\""growth on the cheap\\"" during the 90's was fueled by heavy borrowing from abroad; and instead of making long-term investment with the money, it facilitated heavy consumption at home and profligate private investments in things like the dot-com boom and fiber optics.<br /><br />In addition to undermining the positive economic narrative of the 90's, Stiglitz offers prescriptions of his own to avoid a repeat of the decade's failures.  His prescriptions are chiefly aimed at redressing two major problems which he deems were, and continue to be, pervasive: lack of perfect information and the presence of conflicts of interest.  Behind virtually every failure he identifies - stock market bubbles, accounting scandals, predatory lending, outsize CEO pay - he perceives the source of the trouble to be erroneous information and conflicts of interest; and, accordingly, the panacea as: Better info! Optimize interests!<br />Ironically, this argument is liable to be met with no objection from the targets of his critique: market fundamentalists.  Free marketers, going all the way back to their father Adam Smith, maintain that markets are only workable where there are low barriers to entry, lots of buyers and sellers, and perfect information.  So too would free market proponents support a proposal to make sure the interests of, say a corporate executive and a stock-holder in that corporation, are aligned, so long as the overarching interest of the corporation is to maximize profits.<br />Notwithstanding Stiglitz's resolve to combat the shortcomings of capitalism, the only weapons he seems willing to wield are those provided by capitalism itself.  And although he does pay lip-service to social justice, it is this limitation that has prevented him from wrestling with the deeper problem that, even  if we lived in a world of perfect transparency and perfectly aligned interests (whatever that means), unemployment, poverty, pollution, etc., might all still persist.  And what then?"
526,0986005207,5,"The other reviewer is right, several 5-star reviews of Ranger Danno's book were inexplicably credited to a romance novel.  My previous review is of Rob Danno's book, not the romance novel.  I hope somebody at Amazon.com sees and corrects this.<br /><br />Rob Danno's book unfortunately rings true; with his description of a secret deal by the National Park Service's administrators, which cheated 300 million Americans in order to do an illegal favor for a billionaire, in the process destroying the career of a courageous whistleblower.  One would expect this kind of occurrence in a third-world country, not the United States of America."
527,1453818138,3,"Perhaps I was expecting too much for a book of this price, but I was hoping for a lot more detail. It's a nice introduction, briefly going over many aspects of facial character drawing. Jim Van Der Keyl is undoubtably a brilliant exponent of his art, but this book is more of a broad summary of the subject, and we don't get to share much of his valuable knowledge. It looks like it was knocked together pretty quickly, and could have done with a proof-reader. I certainly enjoyed it, but would have liked to see some more specifics on what really makes a great caricature; stuff such as treatment of eyes and mouth, which he does so well but fails to explain in much detail."
528,146975813X,5,"The author honestly shares every thought and emotion and takes you along with her on this miraculous journey. It is a wonderful read for anyone going through or that has gone through infertility, as well as those who know someone going through it. It makes those going through it know they're not alone and helps others to be more understanding and sensitive towards those who may be having trouble conceiving. Most of all it makes us count our blessings for all of our ordinary miracles. It's also a great combination of just enough facts and information for those who may be considering fertility treatments and need an honest description of what it's like both physically and emotionally from someone who has experienced it firsthand. The author's courage, faith, and determination is an inspiration."

530,1566892740,3,"Adam, the poet/slacker with a fellowship in Madrid at the center of Leaving The Atocha Station, is an off-putting jerk - but take a closer look. Under the guise of his hashish and tranquilizer fueled narration is a well written and sharply observant novel that explores academia's most on trend obsessions.  Both the women in Adam's life insist that he is fluent in Spanish.  Yet we see him struggle with every level of impairment to comprehension imaginable - his drug habits, the lies he dishes out and takes,the pretentiousness of academia and his participation in it, his projections about his own situation.  At one point, he is reduced to being a mere tourist lost in a strange landscape. It's stunning and a little contrived that he's convinced anyone, madrilenos or no, of his poetic ability.<br /><br />What do we expect from language?  What are its limits?  What does fluency in a language mean? How do we comprehend? And what's going to happen when his parents get the bill for the fancy restaurant and jewelry?<br /><br />I recommend this novel, it's amusing, and reminded me of why I'm not in academia. Please consider a three a true endorsement because I find many newly released novels unreadable."
531,0307592731,5,"Personally, this book touched me, though others have different opinions. I was touched by Cheryl's emotional journey, and also by her physical journey. I was impacted by her strength and tenacity, and also about her being honest with herself about her own flaws. She was able to face her mom's death in a clearer mind and come to terms with her life, and which one of us would not love an opportunity to do just that while also experiencing nature. I thought this book was well written, honest and even funny at times. I will try Mrs. Strayed other novel because I enjoyed her writing so much in this memoir."
532,1890622990,5,"Chuck Fisher is quite a character.  If half of what he told in this book is accurate, he had a profoundly colorful life with many adventurous exploits.  I am sure many of them did not seem like adventures at the time.  Some were nightmares.  Like the time one of his superiors tried to get him killed.  It was just good fortune that allowed him to survive that episode.  I met Chuck Fisher at a book signing when I bought his book and he was an interesting man with a slightly different demeanor than you would expect.  I expected a gruff, cursing egomaniac based on what I had heard.  He was actually fairly soft spoken, possibly due to the chronic lung disease caused by his years of heavy smoking.  But he was not the aggressive person you would expect from the book.  Besides being soft spoken, he displayed a very introspective, sharp intellect.  It was clear that he was a very deep thinker, not a brutish outspoken egocentrist like many pilots.  He was also huge.  Very tall and undoubtedly, before disease claimed him, very well muscled man.  His book is fascinating reading and shows how his fantastic knowledge of airplanes and flying saved his life on many occasions.  It tells how, on one occasion, how he saved a multimillion dollar B-52 test airplane and likely his own life and the lives of his crew by flying and safely landing a damaged airplane that other aeronautical engineers said was unflyable.  Exciting reading that makes you feel like you were there with him."
533,0615597424,5,"Dandelion Growing Wild is a remearkable book about one of America's/World's leading marathoners during the 80's and 90's.  However, what is compelling about the book is not the athlectic trimuph (which is outstanding in its own right) but rather it is the story of humanity rising above the tragedies of life.  I think it was William Faulkner in Wild Palms who wrote \\""between nothingness and grief, I choose grief.\\""  Kim recounts how in the shadow of her own personal tragedies, she accepts the grief and transcends it with the endurance and spirit of a truly great athlete."
534,0843189584,5,Wonderful set of books!!! We were familiar with the Little Men books (had the entire set) and used them extensively with our 3 boys and numerous foster children so it was a given that we would enjoy the Little Miss books. Perfect night time reading...just right for Dads who prefer a shorter book before bedtime. Our daughter (age 6) loves to be able to read them TO Dad but also likes to have them read to her.
535,0938045806,5,"Two of the greatest strength training minds come together to discuss strength training as a whole for everyone. It goes from basic foundations to elite athletic training. It is a very no nonsense book with depths that one can ponder how great this book is after each page. As a trainer who has seen it all, and finally getting to understand what training really is, I see the insights into this book as to what training is supposed to be before it got commercialized by gimmicks and tom-foolery techniques that don't apply to most the population.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with the RKC, it is a kettlebell training system from the eastern block. Russian and eastern training methodologies meets the west with Dan John who has a very impressive resume and a lifetime worth of experience, both personal and with thousands of athletes. Having personally gone from the western mindset for training towards the eastern mindset and its fusion with some of the applicable western ideas; I can tell you that for those who have the courage to simplify, read this book and see it as a paradigm shift will reap major rewards. You will not regret it. There is a reason why the kettlebell explosion and the RKC's training methods have been mystifying westerners with its fantastic results has been occurring for the last ten years. Because it works, its simple and its a man-maker. Get on board or get left behind."

He captures the moments in words that totally resonate with me. It's like he's writing my thoughts down. I am so encouraged by his journey and his willingness to share it with us. He also shares the thoughts of another long time Harry mentee, Libby Lyman, whose message on 'free search' has also inspired me to experiment with this on my new mustang mare."

I literally read for 6 hours straight, sitting in a chair, stopping only to turn the lamp on when it got dark.  I knew the outcome, had cried many tears during the time the book speaks of, but John's re-telling of it, nothing short of amazing.  Whether you know the authors or not, this book will change you.  Having your life altered in such a way and then having the courage to share your insights honestly and vulnerably, quite a brave thing to do and John does it well.  Few books have affected me as deeply as this one, truly a masterful work."

540,0764229486,3,"A decent addition to the series, fans of the House of Winslow will not be disappointed.  The action scenes are well written, and the book is a definite page-turner.  The only two things that bugged me were some historical inaccuracies, and a few grammatical errors.  The book contains a few references to characters serving in Nelson's navy at Trafalgar (which occurred 25 years after the events depicted in this book), and Admiral de Grasse's name is misspelled throughout.  Those oversights are not really that big of a deal compared to the misuse of \\""thee\\"" and \\""thou.\\""  One would think that an English professor and former pastor would have a handle on when to use one versus the other, but alas, every time Dan Greene spoke, it came across as stilted and unrealistic.  This happened enough to be annoying.  Overall, a solid novel, and I will definitely be reading the next in the series.  Thou shouldst, as well."

It was a waste of time, too.<br /><br />Take the time to develop some real material here worth publishing rather than just a rambling brain dump.<br /><br />There is little-to-no original thinking in this book.<br /><br />Maybe it is valuable to have common-knowledge anecdotes and heresy about procrastination repeated to you. if so, I'll save you the trouble with some examples:<br /><br />\\""I have heard of some companies restricting email use to just the last ten minutes of each hour.

545,0615629806,5,"In Hunter's Moon, McCoy answers questions that we must've thought about, but blew off, and questions we didn't even think to ask.  Questions like: \\""Why are there so many mouse traps at the local hardware store, when the oldest and crudest, is still the most effective?\\""  And: \\""How did that TV detective, happen to get so many murderers to confess their crimes over the course of so many freakin' years?\\""  And, \\""You really wanna know what happens when you mess with Sasquatch?\\""<br /><br />You like Blood and gore?  McCoy supplies a righteous amount of it, though it's never gratuitous violence.  Frostbite, the first story in the collection sets the pace with a gut wrenching, as well as heart wrenching tale about the horrors faced during the siege of Leningrad.  Moon Shadow is a grizzly alien invasion survival story.  Season Opener is a nice piece about a father and son indulging in a popular outdoor sport, only to find themselves with a on-field view of a totally different game!  The Find is easily the goriest and most unsettling tale in the book: a Bigfoot tale that ain't no Harry and the Hendersons!  Bitch queen is my favorite tale for so many reasons, but I don't want to elaborate too much, for fear of spoiling the fun.  Let's just say; If Raymond Chandler had taken acid, and lived long enough to have seen a David Cronenberg flick, he might've wrote something like this!  The Regular is a horrid take on an old joke that begins: so, this guy walks in to a titty bar...<br /><br />There's also some well written science fiction horror in Hunter's Moon, namely: The Last Line, and Playtime.  Those who are no strangers to the genre can tell that McCoy is a close friend of it. Playtime is an excellent nanotech horror piece.  The Last Line has one thinking: Soylent Green, and the writer has no qualms with critically tearing down that Heston flick.  In short, Hunter's Moon is indeed, visceral as advertised.  It is also intelligent.  It contains moments of horror and of humor.  To sum it up, Hunter's Moon is a very cool ride.  From Frostbite, to A Dish Best Served Cold, Hunter's Moon is way cool!"

I'm sure this must be some type of hoax perpetrated by a 10th grader, with unsupervised access to the internet, because it's hard to believe that an adult actually wrote this drivel. Simply put, the characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialog is beyond childish, and the writing is sophomoric.  Oh, and the book has no plot. I've never read a book with no plot before, and in the future, I'll try to avoid reading another.<br /> I will say I'm not a fan of the subject matter, but I have read books by talented authors that have explored the subject matter , and I really enjoyed them. Go figure! Maybe it was the fact that the books were well written,  with a  storyline that had a purpose.<br /> I have a thing about violence against women.  About women that are abused, demoralized, and dehumanized for the enjoyment of others; call it a silly quirk of mine. There is nothing fun, or flirty , or sexy about the BDSM in this book. This man enjoys inflicting pain on woman for his enjoyment, he states it over and over. The hero *cough, cough* wants to inflict as much pain on this girl as she can tolerate for his pleasure. He stalks an innocent, young woman, and then spends the entire book trying to convince her that it's a freeing experience to be hurt and humiliated, and how much she'll enjoy the experience. I'm sorry, I just don't get it. This man is no romantic hero, and he is beyond flawed.  I'll stick with writers whose alpha males are flawed, but don't need to abuse women for their enjoyment.<br />I must say, that reading the smart and clever reviews has been more enjoyable that reading this book. ~Kate August"

Patrick Bowers and his step-daughter Tessa are like old friends by now, and I want to keep reading about them for years to come. I love how James tells Patrick's story in first-person, but all the other characters are third-person. It keeps the pace of the story quick, while reminding us who it's about. This book, like his others, reads like a high-adventure action movie. I had my suspicions about how the book would end, but the very last page left me speechless. I only have 2 problems with the stories: there have been so many \\""bad guys\\"" in his books that it's hard to remember \\""now, which one was that?\\"" and from the information given, Patrick was really, REALLY young when he worked his first big case, and I find that a bit hard to believe.

559,0883781999,1,"This book reads like it was written by someone whose entire existence was lived inside a bubble of racism, self-hatred, hopelessness and fantasy. To fully appreciate Bell's book you must take the man, himself, and his personal views into account as you read his writing. Desegregation was the very antithesis of his theory about racism. Bell refused to acknowledge the extraordinary, quantifiable gains made by blacks in America since desegregation. The progress in racial equality and race blindness that had resulted in America by the time Bell wrote this book profoundly undermined the credibility of his theory about racism. It is blatantly obvious that this story book was a desperate effort by Bell to restore life in a philosophical theory already proven wrong by the real world application of desegregation. Bell's entire life and renown were all about his theory. To admit he was wrong was not an option for him.  Even his attempts at levity in this book fall short because they read false.  Had Bell lived in the real world, rather than inside his insulated bubble of unrealistic theories of race and hatred, he would have written an entirely different book - an uplifting one, filled with encouragement and hope for the future of blacks in all countries around the globe. His was a sad, tormented life of self-delusion. You come away from this book feeling pity for the author. The book has a Don Quixote feel about it, sans the literary quality."

561,0446697966,1,"I cannot review the overall content of this book because I returned it soon after my purchase.<br /><br />I was really excited to read this book after hearing about it during an NPR radio program. It sounded like an interesting read. I got 10-15 pages into the book and I'd had enough. I like writing styles that get to the point. Say what you have to say, support it with some background or examples and move on. There were some paragraphs that went on for a page whose point could have been made in 3-4 sentences. The rest was fluff with obscure references (perhaps literary) that I couldn't follow. The author seemed to have enjoyed hearing himself type, talk, think or whatever. Maybe the reading got better farther into the book but I wasn't willing to find out. It's exhausting to have to stop at the end of each paragraph and consider what exactly its point was supposed to be.<br /><br />Before anyone criticizes my intelligence, please consider that I'm not a genius but I am a college-educated man. His writing style is just not for me. I compare it to musical theater. Why should I have to sit through a 5-minute song when 30 seconds of dialog could have conveyed the same message?"

564,0545265355,5,"Physically the books are great. Hardcover and well put together, and also at a great price. Nice solid hardcover that protects the books from being bent. Also the little box they come in is nice. Nothing special but it does the job of keeping the books together, I'm not sure what else people might want from a box. Getting all three books together was great I was able to easily go from book 1 - 3 without stopping. I finished book 2 put in back in the box and pulled out book 3 and started reading.<br /><br />The story was also great. If you've seen the movie there are a lot of similarities but there are also a lot of difference and a lot more detail that helps you understand the significance of what is going on. Book 1 was probably the hardest to put down. Very few books can get me from page 1 and not let go. Book 2 and 3 where also fun reads but they started off a little slower. While I was reading book  2 the first half was very tense but I couldn't see how it would be dragged out for 300+ pages, however once it is revealed man I devoured the rest of the book. Book 3 also started off similarly slow. Probably because it seems like the first half of the book is about her mental state and the decisions she has to make. The ending is sad and happy I wish I could change parts of it but I understand that although a happily ever after ending would make me feel better it wouldn't be realistic.  I hope that makes sense I'm trying to be vague so I don't give away to much.<br /><br />Over all<br />Get the books great reads I read through all 3 books in 10 days and if not for other responsibilities would have been finished much much faster."
565,0811835286,5,"I really love this book.  I like to have a soup going just about everyday and this book has so many different kinds.  It's my go-to book for soup.  The recipes may seem like they call for a lot of ingredients, but don't be overwhelmed by that.  Just find the few soups that you want to make over and over again and stock up on those spices and herbs.  I'm fortunate to have a store nearby that sells in bulk, so I can buy small or large quantities versus having to buy a whole bottle.  And sometimes I don't use a spice in the ingredients. For tonight's soup, I did not spend $9.00 on the little bottle of saffron threads.  I'm sure it will slightly change the flavor of my soup but so what? I'm picky about what I'm willing to spend money on. I have found all of the instructions correct and easy to follow.  I would highly recommend this book, especially if you're like me and pretty much need a recipe for anything."

This story satisfies both the people who are looking for horror but also for those who enjoy a love story or two.

Now there is an opportunity to go further into the healing work of addressing the pain and confusion caused from the experiences of growing up as an adoptee or from being separated from your child through adoption. Most of the books about life after adoption are personal, or clinical. These books have been helpful, but Joe Soll's works are unique, and focus on doing actual therapeutic work. This supplement comes from Joe's work as a therapist and his own life experiences.<br /><br />It is rare to find a person who has devoted so much energy to helping others heal. Joe has met people from all over the world through his clinical practice, workshops and healing weekends. The common threads revealed from hundreds of stories are woven into a guide for practicing healing exercises, changing the way you perceive yourself, and recognizing the crazymaking world of the clueless general public.<br /><br />As an adoptee and clinical social worker, I have found Adoption Healing...a path to recovery Supplement timely and useful.Joe's work touches everyone with validation. He goes beyond sharing stories to guiding one through and beyond the pain. I am grateful that Joe Soll continues to share the depths of his wisdom and to reach out to give us all a voice."
569,1460990757,5,"It's always so nice to find one where hardcore asylum-crazy is done RIGHT! As opposed to, say, the Hollywood version.<br /><br />The Crane Institute - known as the Loon to anyone not within earshot of Dr. Crane, who doesn't find it even slightly humorous - is not a place with therapy groups, crafts, or quirky patients who are well-groomed and really just misunderstood.<br /><br />It's a scary place. A scary place of restraints, heavy medication, and staff who take the security measures very seriously. It's a prison of the old school, a fortress, a hulking pile of thick walls, locked doors and bars.<br /><br />It's where the worst of the worst are kept. Mentally ill offenders, in the legal parlance. Effin' sick monsters, in other words. These guys aren't here to be counseled, treated, rehabilitated or cured. They are here because since we can't exactly put them down like rabid dogs, they've gotta be kept somewhere.<br /><br />So, yes, in terms of the setting and psychopathology, the author nails it. In terms of realistic characters who have reasons to be where they are, also nails it. In terms of writing, dialogue, action, everything. Nails it!<br /><br />And in terms of the trope where your characters are someplace already isolated and dangerous, and you want to cut them off further from rescue/escape? Instead of the Total Coincidental Storm Of The Century popping up midway through out of nowhere, this time it's established right from the beginning, taken into account, and plausible.<br /><br />Even the plot with the woman and her kid who show up makes sense. When you're on the run from such a bad scenario that seeking refuge at the asylum seems safer, you know things have really hit the fan.<br /><br />All that, plus Dr. Crane turns out to be a mad scientist conducting heinous experiments? Something even deadlier than the inmates lurks in the hidden recesses of the Loon?  Something that gets OUT to go on a ravenous rampage? Awwww yeah!<br /><br />But, you know what? I was hooked long before any of that. I was hooked by the prologue, which presents the tragic anguish and agony of a parent facing the most terrible possible loss in a too-true and heartwrenching way.<br /><br />The Loon is, hands down, an excellent book. I read it in the span of two days and would have finished it even quicker if there hadn't been all these WHC panels and events that kept getting in the way!"
570,1449306373,5,"If your work revolves around projects - whether you work in design, construction, technology or another field - and you use (or are required to use) Microsoft SharePoint, then you really need this book.<br /><br />In this eagerly awaited update of the previous edition that covered SharePoint 2007, Dux Raymond Sy takes you by the hand and shows you the capabilities of SharePoint 2010 as a Project Management Information System, or PMIS. Having bought the first book, I was alerted by O'Reilly of the availability of the updated book. I grabbed the second edition as quickly as possible. The differences between SharePoint 2007 and 2010 are many, and it is preferable to get the edition that covers the version that you use at your place of work.<br /><br />The renowned speaker, author, blogger and Microsoft MVP shows the SharePoint novice how to use the platform for creating a PMIS, managing stakeholder interaction, task distribution, project tracking, uploading documents and implementing workflows, and other important project steps.<br /><br />Assuming you have been tasked with implementing SharePoint and have read a technical book and learned some of the ins and outs of this powerful software, you might be wondering `OK, so how do I use all that?' Dux first defines SharePoint thus: `SharePoint allows individuals in an organization to easily create and manage their own collaborative solutions'. He then proceeds to answer your query by taking you on a small tour of SharePoint's capabilities as a PMIS.<br /><br />You might also be a project team member who has started to use SharePoint because it has recently been implemented at your company. In that case, this book will of tremendous help: a series of `Workshops' chock-full of screen captures form the skeleton of this book, making it easy to read for anyone interested in SharePoint or tasked with using it on a daily basis.<br /><br />The compatibility with Microsoft Office and the familiar Office-like interface of SharePoint 2010 makes learning the basics a breeze with Sy's help. My only beef is that I wished the book could have been longer, specifically regarding the use of workflows. Coverage of the interaction between SharePoint and Visio would have also been helpful, but there are other books - of a more technical nature - that deal with Visio and workflow implementation.<br /><br />All in all, this book is highly recommended, and a valuable addition to any SharePoint library. In fact, I advise you to start here if you are relatively new to SharePoint."
571,0373267215,4,"First Line: I barely had time to slide my hotel key card into the slot before a loud crash, thud, and clatter set my heart racing.<br /><br />Former Miami judge Sylvia Thorn's heart should be racing. She let herself be railroaded into accompanying her mother's seniors group, the Florida Flippers, to a weekend of fun in Laughlin, Nevada, and Oatman, Arizona, and they haven't even settled into their hotel rooms before a body is found in one of them.<br /><br />The seventy- and eighty-somethings are excited because of the body found in Sarah Pringle's bathtub, and they're all set to investigate the murder. That first night all the Flippers run around the casino asking questions while Sylvia has the feeling that Sandra and her roommate Patsy know more than they're letting on. Sure enough, next morning finds Sandra missing. And speaking of feelings, Sylvia's brother Willie is in Florida, and he can feel that his sister's in trouble. Nothing doing but he and their father hop the next flight out. The stage is now set for all kinds of goings on.<br /><br />Sylvia and the Flippers go to Oatman, Arizona. By this time, Sylvia realizes that she's signed on to herd excited cats. When their tour of a nearby gold mine is ruined by a grisly discovery, the ladies are more willing to settle down and listen to the local police and an FBI agent who is now on the scene. The Flippers are in danger, and Sylvia knows she's going to have to work hard to keep them all accounted for... and safe. The situation doesn't necessarily improve when Willie and their father show up.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book with all its elements of the Keystone Kops. Anyone who's spent any time at all with a group of spry senior citizens knows the probable outcome if said group is on vacation and smack dab in the middle of a murder investigation. Stoltey had me caught between bouts of laughter and frustration as those \\""little old ladies\\"" went to work.<br /><br />Any time the action took place in Oatman, I was even happier. I've been to this old mining town on Route 66 several times, and Stoltey really captured its ambiance.<br /><br />The cast of characters in this book is so good. The Flippers are a hoot, and Sylvia is a level-headed woman who doesn't panic-- even though she does need to learn to relax more. Sylvia's brother, Willie, is also a wonderful character who adds so much to the book. A Vietnam veteran, Willie suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, but he's learned how to deal with it and has made a good life for himself. He also happens to be a bit psychic, which can be both a blessing and a curse for his sister, depending on the circumstances.<br /><br />I couldn't help but wish there was a tiny bit more to The Desert Hedge Murders as I read. In one scene, Sylvia is planning a night-time visit to the old gold mine, and all the Flippers start digging through their purses to provide Sylvia's fanny pack with emergency items. The things the Flippers toss at her are funny in and of themselves, but I was envisioning Sylvia stuck down in the mine trying to be MacGyver with all those goodies. Alas, it was not meant to be, probably because Sylvia is Sylvia, not MacGyver, and she doesn't need to imitate anyone else. This book-- minus my wishful thinking, thank goodness-- is thoroughly enjoyable. Read for yourself!en happier.

572,0312641699,1,"I am disappointed to say that I was unable to continue reading this book after 20 pages. I like to read about and/or imagine a character's accent but to actually read and try to interpret the writing written as the accent is impossible. I'm not sure what the accent the author was trying to show in her writing but in writing the book this way made it way too confusing and hard to read. I kept having to go back and reread pages to figure out what the character was referring to, or where the book was heading. I just didn't like the way it was written and couldn't bare to continue reading it.<br /><br />Here's just a brief summary of what I am talking about:<br /><br />\\""Anybody here?\\""<br /><br />I got to listen good, cos if someone been upstairs waiting for me, I want to hear them creaking on the floor above.<br /><br />But the only creaking is just the old house moving in the cold.<br /><br />And there aint no answer.<br /><br />I put my hand against the wall and feel my way down the passage. I can feel every lump under the cold plaster, and I know my palm's gonna be dusty white if I can see it. I come to the coats still hanging on the pegs, the fur all soft. But no one go out without their coat in this weather? I don't understand why the coats still here and the people aint.<br /><br />I got a funny feeling about being all alone in the house, cos my back's to the door and it's dark and I don't like it with no one here.<br /><br />But like the dog say, Can't stop to think about that now.<br /><br />I get to the kitchen, the same roundside smells seeping out of the dark. I tap along the beam to find the box of tinder, cos I got none in my pouch-but the box fall to the floor with a bang. It really make me jump, and I got to stay still for a while more. But no one come leaping out the shadows, so I reckon the house is safe for now.<br /><br />The dog worrying me too much. Thing is dogs can't make fire and stuff, so they got to be more careful than us. That's the only trouble with wearing the dog skull. The spirit of that dog get right inside me sometimes, and I forget who I am. That's what my dad say when he make me stay in the house with the others and do my reading with Magda.<br /><br />I say, \\""Dad I can read enough.\\""<br /><br />With that being said, I DO NOT discourage you to try and read this book. As this book was not a good read for me it might be the best read for you. I like reading stories written with English grammar but maybe you like reading these types of stories. So by all means, if this is something you might like, I'll recommend this to you.<br /><br />Like I said, I didn't get very far in the book and believe it or not I can't recall what it is I read in those 20 pages so please scroll up for a synopsis."

578,B000T6BGGM,5,"I attended Lutheran schools from Grade 5 through high school, during which weekly \\""chapel\\"" was a compulsory class held in the attached church of our school.  I remember this as being a high point of my youthful life, as there was so much uplifting joy in those Lutheran services, back when they sang the service and hymns in the traditional King James version style...for instance, back when the Holy Spirit was the Holy Ghost, and words like thence and spake were commonplace.  This service book & hymnal was originally published in 1958 but reissued yearly through 1975 (this version), and is in the Evangelical Lutheran style of the day, with all the favorite hymns I loved dearly included, before the wording was modernized -- songs include Crown Him With Many Crowns, Holy Holy Holy Lord God Almighty, and Praise to the Lord the Almighty the King of Creation, as well as numerous famous Christmas tunes, and many American anthems including God Bless America and O Beautiful For Spacious Skies.  The musical notes are all there if you play and instrument to refresh your memory, or if like myself the tunes were so ingrained in you that you will enjoy the almost total recall.  I am still a churchgoer but the times they have a-changed, and this book is a sweet reminder of simpler, joyful times."
579,006197806X,2,"I have to admit I was disappointed by PANDEMONIUM.  BEFORE I FALL and DELIRIUM were such amazing books that I could not wait to get my hands on this one, but I thought it fell flat compared to the other two.  There is a certain magic in Lauren Oliver's writing that I just didn't see in this book--her prose is beautiful, but in this book it came off as almost preachy.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />I won't mention BEFORE I FALL because it is such a different type of story, but I thought PANDEMONIUM really was missing the magic of DELIRIUM.  In DELIRIUM, I really felt Lena's issues with society, her immersion in this strange distopian culture, and I thought the growing love between her and Alex was palpable.  Alex never teaches her how to love, he accompanies her while she learns what it is like.  I really thought the message was quite unique: the book of SHH is right--love does make you crazy!  But it is a craziness that you should be unwilling to live without.<br /><br />In PANDEMONIUM, I felt nothing for Julian at all.  This could be because the roles are reversed and Lena is now the instructor, and we can't get inside Julian's head, but I really felt that Julian was a very sterile character.  Lena seems to love him because he is there, and because he has a nice back--honestly, that's the first moment in the book where I actually felt Julian was Lena's age.  Earlier on, he was 12 or 13 to me, although I knew from the text that he was older.  This same sterility goes for his request for Lena to \\""show him what it's like\\"" with a kiss--there was no passion, in my opinion, in his request.<br /><br />Finally, Alex.  I have to admit that I read a spoiler before I read the book, and I knew Alex was coming back.  When I got to the last page I realized how late in the game he does return, but I was fine with it, and ready to see my favorite character (and perhaps some of the passion) come back in the next book.  What I saw was just...disheartening.  First, it's impossible to know what Alex has gone through, so obviously his words and thoughts are coming from a very dark place.  But did he not almost die in order to give Lena the chance to live and love?  His burst of \\""don't believe her, she's a liar\\"" was just...unnecessary.  No one who loves someone else believes that they are capable of throwing them to the side without an explanation.  If he realizes that Lena thought him dead, he's just being stupidly cruel.  If he doesn't realize that, well...okay, I guess I'm interested.<br /><br />I will read the next book in the series because I love Lauren Oliver's work before this, but I hate that this book was missing the magic.  I sobbed at the end of both BEFORE I FALL and DELIRIUM because of the beautiful way the book came full-circle (the only other author i know who does this is John Irving), but this one didn't do this for me at all--i found myself skipping over endless description, trying to get to the scenes that never came."

581,8170943957,5,"This was the first book by SwAmiji that I read, and it is one of the best things I've done.<br /><br />In late 2009, just days before I left from India for USA, I was given this book by an elderly gent who felt it might be of use to me someday. I politely accepted the book, while in my mind, I impolitely brushed the thought of ever reading it away. To set the record straight, I had no intention of reading it to begin with. I had a long flight ahead, and as an enthusiastic Jain, I had supposedly packed a Jain scripture to read on the airplane.  Through some twist of fate- less romantcally my good karma fructifying- the books got mixed up presumably while packing, and I ended up carrying SwAmiji's 'Teaching of the Bhagavad GitA' instead.<br /><br />Having little choice, and no one interesting to talk to, I opened up the book to kill time. No sooner had I started reading, than I realized it was nothing short of extraordinary.  For the next few hours I was entirely fixated. The exposition was brilliant, and the sheer perfection involved in giving meaning to the verses of the Gita was not to be found elsewhere.<br /><br />Unlike what most authors/interpreters would have you believe, the Bhagavad GitA is not a work focusing on the personality 'Krishna', but rather the truth of Krishna, which is the non dual, all pervading, unchanging, ever-lasting, limitless self- the AtmA.<br /><br />The Upanishads describe AtmA as sat chit Anandam- existence, consciousness, limitlessness. This very teaching clearly establishes the fact that the self cannot be two, or many, but it is one alone, and it is this self that vivifies not only you and I, but also Lord Krishna. Swami VidyAranya ji, the famous 13th century ShankarAchArya of Sringeri Peetham says that the consciousness that enlivens BrahmAji, is the same consiousness also enlivening this blade of grass.<br /><br />Our scriptures carefully make the distinction between information and knowledge. Knowledge- j&ntilde;Anam, is not whatwe are used to referring in common parlance. Only information that is well assimilated in the mind can be termed as 'j&ntilde;Anam'. This knowledge of the self emancipates the individual from the shackles of ignorance, and thereby all limitations we superimpose upon the limitless self. Take a transparent crystal and place it to a red flower, it will appear to share the same colour. This is adhyAsA, or superimpostion. A person may not be wary of the fact that the red-ness is only an appearance, and he may be called 'ignorant' with regard to the nature of the crystal. Similarly, to a person ignorant about his real nature, the self \\""appears\\"" to take up the qualities of the non self- the manifold world of variegated objects- and will thereby also accept their limitations.<br /><br />Moksha is a freedom from limitations that comes from the removal of self ignorance through knowledge of the self. This is the essence of not only the Bhagavad GitA, but the entire Canon of Vedic literature. SwAmiji plays the role of a perfect Guru, as he unfolds the same.<br /><br />Two years down the line- and hopefully wiser- I am blessed to have read this book, and doubly blessed to have listened to his lectures in person. May the teachings of Krishna bhagwAn be kept ever alive through such mahAtmAs.<br /><br />hariH Om tat sat."

583,1606995030,5,"This novel earns its status as a literary work, but it also packs enough storytelling pizazz to keep even the most jaundiced reader turning pages. It's got gangsters, barroom brawls, a chase through the circus and an illicit love affair, with stunning period atmosphere dripping from every page. The author has obviously done his research, right down to the vernacular of the time. You won't read a contemporary novel whose dialog sounds as authentic as this one.<br /><br />The Big Town itself, which is never named in the book, is a construct entirely of the writer's imagination. It is not Chicago, or New York, or any other city that has ever existed off the page. Schulz painstakingly created every street, every building, every train track, vacant lot and hotel room; whole neighborhoods with their individual characters, then laid them out like a master planner to create a complete world through which his characters move. It's a stunning writing achievement. Beyond that, he's made the action of the novel real in a very intimate way; we know the terrain.<br /><br />That terrain includes the emotional. Harry, a man searching for his own identity in his quest for commercial success, and Pearl, a girl at once both worldly-wise and heart-breakingly naïve, are people we know, perhaps even have been. The Big Town takes the reader on a carnival ride through a world populated by characters we recognize despite their attempted masquerade. We look into its funhouse mirror and what we find, though transformed, at times even grotesque, is undeniably ourselves."

The implications of the cap lock, and cartridge small arms, the internal combustion engine, the wristwatch, telegraph, and the Marconi (wireless communications) are grossly neglected.  Even fundamental personality issues like George Washington's personal motives for showing the British how he could perform as a military commander where ignored.  And, for example, the British perceptions of the Declaration of Independence are completely ignored, as are the Canadian perceptions of the French and Indian War.<br /><br />On the other hand, despite the limitations, it provides very good descriptions of tactical action including maps that simplify visualization of the action.  There is room for improvement in the explanations of operational and strategic actions, but it provides the basics.<br /><br />Good, but exactly as described.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court"
586,0813911311,1,"This book is a complete nonsense. Sanford is NOT a historian. He is a christian minister spouting what is clearly contrived christian propaganda lamely attempting to add to the mythology that the founding fathers were all god-fearing christians who founded the US on christian principles.

And there is more than ample evidence to be found by anyone who really wants the truth that Jefferson and others held no superstitious beliefs whatsoever and even condemned christianity. In a letter to Adams (in the archives) Jefferson even says,\\""Christianity is the greatest abomination ever perpetrated upon humanity.\\"" And in his reply Adams seems to agree with him. There are quite a few other letters that give us similar information about the founding fathers. There is plenty of verifiable evidence available to any thinking, discerning person that demonstrate how Sanford's claims in this book are simply not supported by historical facts. Sanford is either deeply deluded, horribly misinformed or just trying to make a fast buck by telling christians exactly what they want to hear. No honest, rational person could examine the evidence and still think Jefferson was a \\""believer\\"". He simply was NOT. What many christians don't want to understand is that in their public affairs the founding fathers gave lip service to god and chritianity, just like politicians do today. It means absolutely nothing to say that some founding fathers mentioned 'god' in their public speeches. Another good example of this is FDR. He never seemed to miss the chance to invoke god in his public life. But years after his death, aclose friend wrote that FDR thought christianity, and all other religions, were foolish nonsense. Christians have a right to believe in god if they so choose. I will even defend their right to do so. And no doubt christianity has had some certain amount of influence on our nation throughout the course of its history. But christians do not serve themselves well, or anyone else, when they grossly exaggerate that influence - especially when it comes to a well documented subject like the founding fathers. Anyone can research this and see for themselves. It's not necessary to take anyone's word for it. I really don't understand the christian's near psychotic need to rewrite all of history and try to refashion everything to suit their own wishful thinking.  There was a time when christianity did rule the world -- it's known as the Dark Ages."

589,1582433518,5,"Sybille Bedford, OBE (16 March 1911 - 17 February 2006) was a German-born English writer: a novelist, journalist and biographer.  She was born Sybille von Schoenebeck in Berlin.  Her parents were Baron Maximilian Josef von Schoenebeck (1853-1925 and his wife, Elizabeth Bernard (1888-1937).  Sybille was raised in the Roman Catholic faith of her father at Schloss Feldkirch in Baden, and had a half-sister, from her father's first marriage ( Maximiliane Henriette von Schoenebeck). Her parents divorced in 1918, and she remained with her father, until his death in 1925.  Sybille then went to live in Italy with her mother and stepfather.  With the rise of fascism in Italy, her mother and stepfather settled in Sanary-sur-Mer, a small fishing village in the south of France.  Sybille settled there as a teenager, living near Maria and Aldous Huxley, with whom she became friends. Sybille Bedford also met some of the other writers and intellectuals (including Alma Mahler, Wilhelm Herzog, Lion Feuchtwanger, Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht) who also settled in this area during that period.<br /><br />During this period, Sybille's mother became addicted to morphine and, in what was for me, some of the most moving writing in this memoir, Sybille describes how this occurred and how she became responsible for procuring and administering the drug to her mother.  There is no self-pity in Ms Bedford's account, simply a description of causation, events and consequences.<br /><br />`My next account - not joyful - will have to be about a destructive blow of fate brought about through a blend of antecedents, chance, ill luck.'<br /><br />In 1935, Sybille entered a marriage of convenience with Walter `Terry' Bedford.  The marriage did not last, her use of his family name did.  With the assistance of Maria and Aldous Huxley, Sybille Bedford left France for America before the German invasion of France.  Her memoir ends once she is in America.<br /><br />`Wish I could tell the half of it ... But, I repeat, there seems to be no time.'<br />`Had I but world enough and time ... I have not.  And shall not now write about the life that followed.'<br /><br />This memoir covers Sybille Bedford's life from World War I in Berlin, to World War II when she leaves Europe for the USA.  I do not recognise much of the world in which she lived and of which she writes, but her writing gave me some sense of that world and of her experiences within it.  At one stage, when she has a guest for a period, she writes:<br /><br />`What I minded was the loss of solitude - essential to the cashing in of writing-thoughts.'<br /><br />This is the first of her books I have read: I hope to read some of her novels later this year.  I enjoyed both the content and the presentation of this memoir.  I found it inspiring: there is no room for self-pity, nor is there any sign of resentment.  Things just happen, and they are written about.  Perspectives may change.<br /><br />`To get into one language deeply, I found, one has to forsake all others.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-SmithI repeat, there seems to be no time.'<br />`Had I but world enough and time ...

590,0979554233,5,We have the entire serious of these books and we love them. This makes an excellent gift for any new parent. We have used the techniques stated in the book and find they work quite well. Of course you need to know your children and what works for them. I very highly recommend this book and all of the books in this series.
591,0440245680,1,"This series was very good for the first three books.  Then it started to decline in quality and it has become clear that the author is just milking the idea for as long as she can. This book very badly needs a competent editor. It flips back and forth between several different story lines in a very disjointed way and is too long. Tolstoy can get away with writing 900 or 1,000 page books, but this is not War and Peace quality.  There are no smooth transitions and the book has a very choppy feel and reads like a soap opera cutting from scene to scene. It spends a lot of time focusing on previously very minor supporting characters that are just not very interesting and that the reader has been given no reason to care about, i.e. William. I suppose that is because after the 6 previous books, there isn't much left to say about the main characters. This would be OK if these new starring characters were dynamic, but they aren't.<br /><br />There are also major plot problems. There are coincidences that are just so ridiculous that they make the time travel premise of the book seem believable in comparison.  Just one example:  William is wandering around sick and lost in a vast swamp in Virginia.  Then he runs into his cousin Ian, who was last seen in New York and is apparently just passing through this vast swamp, just in time for Ian to save his life.  What are the odds? If this happened to me, I would make sure to buy a lottery ticket on my way out of the swamp.<br /><br />Then there are the cliff hangers.  The books ends very abruptly with several very definite major cliff hangers. I believe a novel, even if part of a series, should be able to stand to some extent on its own.  This cannot. And since the author takes about 4 years between books, there is no chance of getting resolution in a timely manner.  It is a cheap marketing gimmick, and something I will not support.<br /><br />I stayed with the series because the first 3 books were very entertaining and the 4th wasstill pretty good.  But this was the final straw.  The series should have ended at least a couple of books ago. The author may keep writing books 8, 9 , 10, etc., but I will no longer be buying or reading."
592,0307265633,4,"This was a pretty difficult book to read, but it was amazing!  I've never read anything by Brian Greene before but have always been interested in this sort of subject.  There is so much more to what we see all around us.  It's mind boggling."
593,B001G8WKH6,3,"This book was filled with information about NY in the early to mid-1800's and gave the reader good insight to the development of the police force, the crimes of the time and some government issues. A great portion of this story is Edgar Allan Poe writing his comments concerning the Mary Roger's murderer and along the way, there was lots of information concerning Poe, the man, which I was interested in learning about.  In many ways, this was a book about his life. Since this is, in fact, about a real person's murder and the detection methods used to discover who did it, it proved interesting BUT I do not especially like \\""true crime\\"" types of books so was a little disappointed because I was reading a genre I'm not too comfortable with."
594,1590525191,1,"The author claims that sex is ok but lust is the problem, basically saying that sex is tolerated by god as a mechanical function for procreation, but if you enjoy it then he gets mad.

I thought it was a great read, and felt compelled to get to the finish to take it all in.  I also appreciated his personal views on his faith and how it plays a role in his life.  You may not agree with him, although I do, but I don't see how you can criticize his honest and straightforward answers to his faith.<br /><br />As a runner of similar age I'm also in awe of what Alberto accomplished, and continues to accomplish as a coach.

It was really common sense!  Things like don't label your child such as \\""clumsy\\"" or don't compare your child to their siblings.  If you are intentional in raising your child already then this book is a bust and does not provide any insight.

605,1455522945,3,"how exciting, a book explaining the \\""mormon way of doing business\\""........what next? a book explaining the mormon way of doing politics? (co-authored by Sen Harry Reid, Sen Orin Hatch and Gov Romney?)<br /><br />the basic premise of the book is flawed - there is no \\""mormon way\\"" of doing business. no handbook issued to mormon disciples. each does it his own way. So this is pure pro-LDS propaganda by a mormon author (possibly funded by the mormon/LDS corporation - we will never know since all finances are secretive).<br /><br />Why doesn't he mention the Mariott family with their Mariot hotel chain empire? and why the supply pornography and alcohol in their mormon business and how they reconcile this with the fictional \\""mormon way of doing business\\""?<br /><br />Why doesn't he describe Brigham Youngs corrupt and debauched way of doing business? Or Joseph Smith's illegal bank (Zions Bank - which failed and defrauded members). or the LDS rental of church properties to brothels, their raising tobacco crops, selling alcohol etc - all in direct violation of the strict mormon code of health and articles of faith?<br /><br />The story is well told and entertaining. but superficial and glosses over the reality of life in all its complexity in each instance.<br /><br />One point the author makes very well is (near the end of the book) \\""you can't have it all\\"" - indeed.<br />This book proves just that!<br /><br />The author is biased and is obviously trying to portray LDS corporate high flyers in a most favourable light.<br />He never questions WHAT they believe and WHY they hold such bizarre secretive beliefs (discredited lies) and HOW the cult policies and practices of their religion impact on their family life - OR HOW these men reconcile their hyper-orthodox beliefs with their hard-nosed business practices. how do these men find harmony between the high ideals for Christ-like living on the one hand, and the ruthless corporate world on the other hand? (we could ask the same question of mormon politicians such as Sen Harry Reid on the Left or Sen Orin Hatch on the right)<br />one has to be naieve or gullible to think this book gives a fair and balanced portrayal of the so-called \\""mormon way of doing business\\"". It is really their individual way of doing business and they just happen to claim to be active mormons. The only way that a mormon can thrive in the real world is by living a lie in terms of their hyper-orthodox faith. For example, their faith requires them to live equally with the saints and donate all excess/surplus wealth back to their community. If you doubt this, read the New Testament and read their own prophets teachings on their own scriptures. Yet these men pursue wealth and once gained, horde that wealth - they do not distribute it that all may be rich \\""like unto\\"" themselves.<br /><br />If one wants to understand the so-called \\""Mormon way of doing business\\"" the focus should be on LDS Corporation - not a few private individuals who happen to be mormon. (imagine the naievity of writing a book \\""The catholic way of doing business\\"" - which would be what? Sicilian mafia or something better?)<br /><br />i was a member of the mormon church for 30 odd years before discovering the real origins and unvarnished history of the so-called church (it's a cult by any objective assessment). I resigned from the mormon cult after learning the truth which is readily available via Google, and by reading books on Amazon written by former insiders (eg Grant Palmer \\""Insiders view on mormon origins\\"" and \\""Farewell to Eden\\"" and \\""Standing for Something More\\"" ETC).<br /><br />what remains unanswered is where the real allegiance and loyalty of these corporate junkies lies? since they take free mason type oaths in their 'temples' which requires that their primary loyalty and priority in life be to \\""building up the church/kingdom\\"" on the earth.........and since all their temple oaths are secret and all LDS Corporation finances investments and business activities are secret, not transparent and not independently audited, who knows what is REALLY going on and why mormons heavily infest US military, US Govt, FBI, CIA, etc??<br /><br />If there is no mischief - why all the secrecy? Transparency is the antidote to mischief.<br />This book reveals nothing - just an amalgamation of heart-warming platitudes about what charming family men these mormon corporate men are ....mmm..."

Rickie and his ancient, emotional grandmother run a bookie business from their tiny kitchen, and Ricky is condemned to stay home to answer the phone in case bets are called in.

609,1580176917,2,"I agree with the review posted by Susan W. Swartz \\""beadmomsw\\"".  I was new to sock knitting and magic loop when I purchased this book when it was first published.  For a new knitter, this book WILL NOT explain how magic loop is worked since there are not enough photographs to help a knitter see what it is happening.  And let's face it: when magic looping, you wonder what is going on for the first several rounds or so.  A book that is marketed as being all you need to learn magic loop and knitting socks should contain many well-detailed photographs of the different steps that happen.  Especially when there are so many free internet blogs that do this.<br /><br />Also, this is mmost likely an outdated review now that the author's toe-up book has been published, but this book only contains top-down patterns.  Personally, I think that knitting socks toe-up just makes more sense.  And if, like me, you're a new sock knitter, why learn the old top-down method only to then learn the new toe-up method?  I would rather just learn the toe-up method."

As the remainder of the title states, \\""What Every Businessperson, Citizen, Consumer, and Employee Needs to Know About Business\\"", there is something for everyone in this book. While this is not a typical textbook--more the size of a short novel--it does a great job at defining many concepts in all areas of business. The one thing I would like to see that is not in the book is a glossary or index in the back of the book. It can sometimes be difficult to remember which chapter a term was talked about in detail so I spent quite a bit of time flipping through the chapters trying to find certain terms. Other than that, it was a great book for an Introduction to Business course and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn a bit more about any aspect of business!"

I think it might be easier to use if it was arranged in sections under each individual book or story title; however one must give the compiler credit for thoroughness.(It's true that many entries appear in more than one book.)

620,0345444051,5,"Although being relatively new to the world of Arthur C. Clarke, I think that it is safe to say that Childhood's End is an outstanding novel on it's own.  Following several characters over time, this book maps the path taken by the suspicious and seemingly all-powerful \\""Overlords\\"".  Through an eerily systematic approach (at times making parallels to American colonization by the Europeans), the native humans become more and more accustomed to their presence in their everyday life.  A twist at the end reveals that the Humans and Overlords alike are part of something much bigger than they ever could imagine.  This novel challenges the human intellect and understanding to its deepest roots, questioning mankind's purpose and pushing the reader into thoughts they may or may not have wanted to delve."

Running through the woods, hoping it will qualify him for the track team in the coming year. Being a part of that team would give him the popularity status he so eagerly hungers for. But today isn't his day. Bumping into thugs was not in his plans. Neither was standing up to them and then being accepted into their group.<br /> Sam is a pastor's kid. The minute he makes allegiance with Jeff Winger and his crew, he knows he is in for trouble. But rather than finding himself scared he finds he is actually excited about the possibilities of danger. With two parents involved in church work and a brother absorbed by college applications, he needed a hobby, and just in time. Suddenly he fits in, and is going to be careful not to botch these relationships, even it if it means stealing cars and seeking out trouble.<br /> But things change one afternoon as he heads to the gangs hideout. He sees Jennifer Sales, the school weirdo, wandering the woods. Concerned for her safety, he approaches her. And that's when his gang appears. Things didn't look so good, and they weren't. When Sam realizes his gang is about to harm Jennifer, he has to choose sides.<br /> Suddenly he finds himself with a new friend. And Jennifer was just as weird as people believed her. Especially when she begins to tell him her dreams that are actually coming true. Scared, Sam has to decide if her dreams are just lunacy or possibly prophesy, and before its too late. With time running out, Sam finds himself racing to save the lives of almost everyone he knows. Will he find this was just all a bad dream or that Jennifer has been seeing the truth?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. It was my first by this author and I read it in one day.

One gets the feeling that Lehane himself wasn't really in the mood to write it, and his boredom and disinterest radiate from every page.<br /><br />The book is a follow-up to Gone Baby Gone, and I get the impression that the previous book's less-than-happy ending is what inspired Lehane to write this one. The prose reeks of demons needing to be exorcised, both from private detective Patrick (who returned a kidnapped girl to an unloving home) and from Lehane himself (who probably got a lot of flack from fans for giving his previous book such a downer ending).<br /><br />But while revisiting the previous plot line might have been a good idea, this book just feels tired, stale, and dull. The witty banter Patrick and Angie used to share now seems forced and unfunny. The always-amusing character of Bubba makes only a brief, unimportant appearance. Patrick himself seems to move in slow-motion throughout the book, as if he's pissed off that his creator is forcing him to go through the motions once again.<br /><br />To re-experience that thrill you got from the earlier Lehane books, read them again but skip this latest offering. You'll only end up disappointed."

632,0345384466,5,"The Witching Hour has been one of my favorite books for many years now. It was clear that a lot of thought and effort went into this novel. Not only does the book have a modern day narrative, but also delves into the long and sordid history of the Mayfair Witches for a large part of the book. Since the first part of the book is so interesting and filled with such mystery the reader is actually excited to read the history of the Mayfair witches instead of feeling like they're reading half of a book's worth of exposition. Every time I read this book I always want to know more about each of the witches and about their lives, especially because Anne Rice brought them to life so vividly; they seemed almost like real people from the past she was telling us about. Then, towards the end of the book, when Anne Rice has crafted for us such a rich and detailed history of the family and told us the interesting modern day story of Rowan Mayfair and the modern Mayfair family, she has set the stage perfectly for Rowan's exploration of the decaying house. I quite literally gasped at some of things she discovered in the house, being led by the twisted and horrible Carlotta Mayfair. Also, with all this rich history and a compelling modern storyline, it makes the follow-up books even better and more interesting.  Even after reading all three books I still always feel like I might never know all the secrets of the Mayfair family."

641,1878026097,1,"In fact, if you watch the Youtube videos first (where Brown's hydroplate theory is \\""explained\\"") you will wonder if those animations and this book were intended to be a satire of wacky \\""creation science\\"" pseudo-science.  No.  Brown is for real.<br /><br />I've often wondered if he has ever tried to read through the calculations his critics have done, even if just the heat dissipation problems of his theories on the flood are considered. If he did, it never shows. Brown lives in his own world.<br /><br />I will admit that I lost all patience for Brown and his books when I realized how blatantly he was quote-mining and misrepresenting the facts of Dr. Johanson's LUCY discovery. (From what I can tell, Brown was largely responsible for the now widely-held myth that \\""Lucy\\"" was scattered over a 2-3 kilometer area and discovered over a period of five years. Brown apparently doesn't understand specimen numbering systems and the indexing of field records. But I KNOW that he was corrected by various colleagues but he continues to pass along his special brand of \\""disinformation.\\""  The \\""creation science\\"" entrepreneurs rarely correct what is already selling. Fiction sells better than truth.)<br /><br />So I admit: once I am aware of integrity issues with a \\""scholar\\"", I am cautious about believing absolutely anything they say.  But in Brown's case, his work is so far off the wack-a-doodle meter, it is hard to take it seriously in the first place. And as a Bible-believing Christ-follower (and retired minister, Bible translator, commentator), I am embarrassed that the unsaved world tends to judge us by our loudest wackos.<br /><br />Brown's work rarely makes any sense. This book is no different.  If a reader has limited scientific literacy (and doesn't investigate critiques of Brown's work from the scientific community), this is another cult classic [literally!] that will be loved and enjoyed.<br /><br />I'll put it this way: This book deserves a place right up there with the classics of other \\""creation scientists\\"" who somehow managed to produce total atrocities despite having earned legitimate Ph.D. in some field or other: Henry Morris, Jason Lisle, Kurt Wise, et al.<br /><br />If you already read this book prior to reading my review, I sincerely apologize that I wasn't able to spare you the experience."
642,0805002219,5,"I have been in love with this edition of The Wizard of Oz since I was six years old; I'm twenty-three now. I grew up absolutely absorbed in this edition, first finding it in the library back in grade school. I cannot tell you how many times I checked that copy out--I might as well have owned it.<br />I re-discovered this edition recently, and I received a beautiful hardback copy (bought here on Amazon) for Christmas last year. The moment I opened the book for the first time--in over a decade--it was like being transported back to childhood. I felt I could fall into that world; Michael Hague's illustrations work as an absolutely PERFECT partner to the classic prose of L. Frank Baum. Visually, Mr. Hague created an Oz entirely separate from the movie (the one that everyone knows, and often sees more as Oz than book, unfortunately). Only now can I truly appreciate all that Mr. Hague accomplished. He created an Oz as L. Frank Baum intended it to look, or so I've always thought. This version of Oz has always been, and still remains, home to me. I love it as much now as I did when I was six.<br />To this day, I remain staggered by Mr. Hague's commitment to the details. He kept as visually close to story-descriptions as possible. Every character's appearance seems to be right in line with what L. Frank Baum attended. Everything is depicted in stark realism; nothing just done for show or to be \\""cutesy\\"". I've always admired that.<br />This edition of The Wizard of Oz will continue to live with me for the rest of my life. Nothing can be said about L. Frank Baum's brilliant story that hasn't been said before. Yes, at times, scary creatures seem to pop up out of nowhere, but they're dispatched of just as quickly by our favorite foursome. No reason, in my eyes, for parents to shy away from sharing this story with their children.<br />I can assure you, when I have kids, they will grow up knowing this book. In an age like ours, where books come and go at such rapid pace, the truly timeless works stick with us. The Wizard of Oz is as timeless and classic as they come, and the only way this edition could be better would be if it *actually* transported us to Oz! But the journey of reading and losing oneself in this remarkable edition is in no way second best.timeless works stick with us.

643,0061735124,5,"Holy War: How Vasco da Gama's Epic Voyages Turned the Tide in a Centuries-Old Clash of Civilizations, unsurprisingly, charts the story of the Portuguese explorer and his successful charting of a route to India around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. In some ways it's surprising how Columbus' `discovery' of America so overshadowed this story, especially since both explorers set out in the same decade with the same end in mind, and only Vasco da Gama actually achieved the goal of reaching India and opening up trade routes for spices back to Europe. In another way, it makes sense why Gama's story is lesser known considering how Portugal's overseas empire lasted relatively shortly and how the British and Dutch so thoroughly replaced the Iberians in most of Asia.<br /><br />Nigel Cliff's premise of the book is less about Vasco da Gama than the rationale for the Age of Discovery. Cliff deftly explains how the Crusades, the Reconquista (a crusade itself), Middle Eastern geopolitics and religious fervor seamlessly nurtured the Portuguese exploration of Africa and Asia. This message gets lost in the story of Columbus' voyage to the Caribbean. It's common knowledge that Columbus was sailing in search of trade routes for spices from Asia. What's lost is the religious, as opposed to purely economic, reasons for this journey and why Portugal and Spain took such a lead in trying to undercut Muslim merchants in Istanbul and Alexandria. Cliff begins his book with a short examination of Muslim history as a prelude to the century-long conflict over the Iberian Peninsula. The book begins to slow its pace in the middle of the fifteenth century as the Christian kingdoms begin to fully wrest power and tenuously cross over the Straight of Gibraltar and into modern-day Morocco. Cliff also delves into curious matters like the Medieval European preoccupation with a fabled eastern Christian king, Prester John, whom they believed would be waiting in Asia to unite and destroy the Muslim menace.<br /><br />The book covers, to me, an incredibly interesting story about a minor power whose influence waxed and then waned in the matter of several decades to be replaced by the more lasting empires of northern Europe. I love these types of histories, and Cliff writes a compelling and informative example."
644,B0006F48MK,5,"This work contains over fifty biographical sketches of distinguished Rabbis largely of the nineteenth century. The biographies are told in a clear anecdotal style and each one is rich in insight and information. There is a general hagiographic approach with admiration for the virtues of these Torah scholars, but no real criticism of what may have been other sides of their life. I found this work an opportunity to read about many Rabbis who I knew of by name but had little real information on. A Book that should be far better known and distributed than it presently is."

It is beautifully written, as if the author wrote it to be read aloud.  I loved it so much I sent the author a note telling him how truly wonderful this book was (something I've never done).  As an historian, this book both accurately displays the events surrounding the Apollo 11 mission, but also captures the spirt of anxiety, excitement and exuberance of Americans back on earth.  I literally get choked up everytime I read this story because I can feel the fear and excitement of the people on the Moon and back on earth. I have recommended this book to everyone I know who has young children.  Don't pass up on an opportunity to own a real treasure."

650,1470104768,4,"I truly enjoyed Jeffery Moore's book. It is not the type of book I would typically read, but after reading a preview, I thought that the writing was good, and I found the content to be very intriguing. The author calls his work speculative fiction because it defies categorization into any one fictional genre. I completely agree. Jericho Solus is part historical fiction, part legend, part sci-fi, part fantasy, part romance, and part conspiracy--all with an undercurrent of existentialism.<br /><br />The three central characters in the story are Jericho, the Solus who embodies action and leadership; Gebal, the Insid who personifies wisdom; and Dimash, the Sensum who represents morality. The author does a great job of developing each character around their special trait. And he plays them off one another to create the balance that is necessary. They are part of a legend not unlike those found in many religions throughout history. They are the trinity. Though they must each remain separate, each is dependent on the others. And they are each an extension of an entity referred to as the Father.<br /><br />Although this concept sounds vaguely familiar, it is not as it seems. This trinity is not of this earth, but it also is most definitely not of saints, archangels, and fluffy white clouds. The world created by Jeffery Moore is one of endless time, strange creatures, and green goo. And as strange and alien as it seems, it is also very human. A world of of honor, love, and understanding.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person from Jericho's perspective. This makes perfect sense since he is the part of the trinity that embodies action and leadership; his experiences and reactions in each of the worlds he encounters are a good vehicle for propelling the story forward. Using the first person point of view also works very well because a sense of the unknown is an essential part of the story. Each character goes through periods of not knowing who or what they are, and then they become enlightened. The reader accompanies them as they transform their fear into understanding. The journey takes Jericho and the reader back and forth through time and space. This creates a sense of confusion with an undercurrent of knowing that propels you forward until you have come full circle. In the end, you are left with glittering vestiges of experiences that could each have been legends unto themselves.hen they become enlightened.

655,0615521940,5,"The cover of this book had caught my eye on more than one occasion. I was excited when I finally got around to reading it... and I was not disappointed. Though the cover is stunning, as it turns out, it is the least impressive aspect of this book. Don't take this as criticism; this is a very, very good thing. The beginning of the story hits you with slap-in-the-face action that sucks you right in. The flawless prose and character development keeps you there. Add to these a tight and unique plot, non-stop action, spray on a few tears and sprinkle a pinch of humour, and voila! Jasmine has everything.<br /><br />When it comes to pacing, I find backstory can sometimes be tedious, but Jasmine's history was both engaging and interesting. It is well researched and put together with a diligence that makes the story flow effortlessly. Dobbins makes writing seem easy.<br /><br />I have already alluded to Dobbins' prose, but it is such that it merits a double mention. The authors soul and personality are clearly poured into his words. It is not often that a small press author can induce profound thought in their readers, but if profound thought is injected, then profound thought is encouraged. One line from the book will always stick with me: 'She was obviously covered by that blanket protection that fate sometimes throws over the truly clueless.' Ingenious, and the answer to a frustrating lack of articulation I have been struggling with for years.<br /><br />I'd like to take a tiny detour, if I may - I have said that it's not often small presses can deliver such gems as Jasmine's Tale. This is the fifth book I have read which is published by Post Mortem Press, and I'm beginning to believe they are regular gem dealers.<br /><br />Back to business: Jasmine's Tale: Darkness and Light - firmly, truly, 100%, 5 big shiny ones!"

We've got half a deer in the freezer, and we didn't really know what to do with it before-- we'd tried some recipes from different places and they were okay, sometimes good, sometimes gamey... but every recipe I've tried from this book has been not just good, but SURPRISINGLY good-- the sort of thing that makes you slow down and really TASTE it. The Cabinhaus Venison Stew is a perfect, hearty, absolutely satisfying stew for a cold day. Yesterday, on the other hand, we cooked Marinated Venison Kabobs on the grill-- the recipe itself doesn't LOOK all that remarkable, but one bite and my husband and I looked at each other and said \\""Wow!\\""<br /><br />We're never going to make every recipe in this book, and at some point we're bound to hit one we don't like, but the INCREDIBLE GOODNESS of the recipes we HAVE made is worth... well, trying to thank Edie Franson for."
659,0758266944,4,"Hmm. Where to start? Well... After finishing Touch of Frost (book one) I immediately e-purchased Kiss of Frost. I was THAT hooked. Just knowing that I could continue the journey right then and there lead to the imminent one-click. The Mythos Academy series is quickly becoming one of my guilty pleasures. Kiss of Frost had everything I wanted and then some. All the great characters from book one were back including some new ones mainly in the form of a gorgeous guy from the \\""New York\\"" branch of Mythos Academy. Between Logan's hot-and-cold tendencies, the threat revealed at the end of Touch of Frost, and new guy's advances, Gwen's heart is in danger, physically and emotionally.<br /><br />Touch of Frost was a perfect sequel. Sometimes book series suffer from the a second-book slump but I think book two was even better than the first. Now that we've got to know our characters and their world, the story was able to branch out and progress. Although Gwen Frost found herself a loner in Touch of Frost, she now has a great, knit group of friends whose got her back. She is definitely going need some backup because the action rises threefold in this installment. Freak accidents keep occurring and the only thing connecting them is their blatant target: Gwen.<br /><br />One aspect of Kiss of Frost I really enjoyed was the arcs the characters took. Although at some points I found Gwen a little stubborn she still remains one of the strongest heroines I know. Although she doesn't always think a plan through, she's got a great heart, always putting herself on the line for others. This is a *small spoiler* but I'm really happy with Gwen and Daphne's friendship progression throughout Kiss of Frost.  Daphne really helps Gwen break out of her loner-shell. Even though Gwen spends a good chunk of the book solo, Daphne always, and thoughtfully includes Gwen in her plans and outings. A lot of times Gwen's what they refer to as a \\""third wheel\\"" but Daphne being a great friend, always makes her feel welcome. Their new-found BFF status really is a shining point throughout the book.<br /><br />Also, I want to give a small shout out to Vic the coolest, funniest, and blood-thirstiest talking sword around.

Rene has to be careful because some people would not accept who and what he is. Rene soon finds out that Meryt does not scare easily. Rene and Meryt start building a relationship until Rene's past comes back to haunt him and threaten his connection with Meryt.<br /><br />Eternal Traces takes readers on an unusual journey into the lives of these characters.  The author takes a chance in taking a unique approach to the Egyptian and African culture while mixing it with the unnatural. The storyline was interesting except some areas were not realistic even for the paranormal genre. The cultural aspect did nothing for the story and at times confused me. Overall this was an interesting book with mild twists and turns. I can see from the way the book ends there will be a sequel. I look forward to seeing how the storyline and characters evolve.<br /><br />Eternal Traces was provided by the author for review purposes.<br /><br />Teresa Beasley<br />APOOO BookClub<br />APOOO Rating: 3.5"
667,0984739319,4,"When a person can no longer speak or comprehend, loved ones face decisions they're hard-pressed to understand, let alone make wisely and compassionately. A dying patient's best interests regularly fall victim to the uncertainty.    \\""It's OK to Die\\"" is a user's guide to end-of-life decision-making, told compellingly and accessibly while underscoring the importance for families of not putting off these conversations. \\""It's OK to Die\\"" shares real scenarios as it walks readers toward making smart choices for themselves, and putting those choices in writing.    Alabama Emergency Physician Monica Williams-Murphy and her husband and co-author, Kristian Murphy, clearly believe in the importance of their subject, and I'm impressed with their dedication and their vision. It deserves to find an audience with physicians and the general public alike.    Even someone as clear and purposeful as Dr. Murphy waited nearly too long. She didn't have the conversation with her own beloved grandmother until the latter was in the process of dying. The conversation between the two of them, and with Dr. Murphy and her extended family, is moving and revealing of the importance of such a dialogue to both the living and the dying.    Dr. Murphy and her husband also write of making choices without knowing their loved one's wishes -- and living with the regrets of decisions made in fear.    \\""It's OK to Die\\"" is a straightforward look at the normal dying process. It is for doctors who struggle to tell the patient, You're dying, and for patients and families who don't want to hear it.    As an Emergency physician -- not a palliative care or hospice doctor -- Dr. Murphy offers a unique insight into end-of-life care. Emergency physicians invariably are tasked with making urgent decisions with very little information -- and quite possibly no history whatsoever with a patient. In such circumstances, regrettable decisions are made -- seldom with the result of a \\""good death.\\""    The co-authors are children, grandchildren, and parents. In their own lives, they've experienced good and bad decision-making at end of life. Their insights are personal, and their recommendations hold promise for our dysfunctional healthcare system.    Dr. Murphy is a strong proponent of good palliative care, advance directives (especially the systemically accessible POLST or, in Massachusetts, MOLST forms), and the Personal Self-Assessment Scale, a tool for physicians to help patients \\""(make) medical decisions in advance based on objective markets of quality of life.\\""    Nobody wants to die, but it's not a choice. But you do have a choice to be ready. And while it may require a little courage to engage this book, but the payoff will be well worth it. [...]"
668,0373796617,2,"I'm so disappointed to say I'm disappointed in this book.  Usually, I adore Rhonda Nelson's books, especially her \\""Men Out of Uniform\\"" series.  The premise sounded good, and Jay Weatherford is a wonderfully heroic and flawed character. I loved him immediately and looked forward to the woman that would rock his world.  Unfortunately, Charlie Martin just did not do it for me.  She's clearly supposed to be reminiscent of Emma, Payne's wife from \\""The Specialist,\\"" who I found to be industrious and plucky.  Charlie, meanwhile, is immature and whiny with an unfounded sense of entitlement.  Why she thought she should have been hired by Ranger Security is beyond me.  She hadn't been with the Atlanta PD that long, and nothing was ever expressly said that indicated she was a phenomenal cop worthy of their consideration.  Plus, I didn't care for how deeply she hacked their system, going into their personal lives, etc.  Honestly, I was sort with Guy on that.  She needed to be arrested or sued.  As the story moved along, I found her constant need to one-up Jay tiresome and not endearing as with Payne and Emma.  Because of this, I didn't buy the chemistry between the two.  Jay's side, I could see.  But Charlie's?  Sorry, no deal.<br /><br />The story itself was fine, another quirky case for Ranger Security.  This one had some fun minor characters, which was nice, but unfortunately, I couldn't get past the \\""heroine's\\"" persona.  She really ruined what could have been a great story, in my opinion.  Hopefully, Nelson will be back to her regular form with the next book."

671,030746542X,5,This is a cute book to follow up your belly book with.  I am doing this one along with a baby book that is similar to what my mom had done for me.

672,0801868491,5,"\\""With the Fifth Army Air Force\\"" is an excellent first-person account of the author's time as an Army Air Forces (AAF) communications officer stationed in New Guinea, the Philippine Islands, and on Okinawa during World War II.  The text is factual, interesting, and clearly written --- but it's the photos that make this book a real knockout.  Mr. Gallagher was a first-rate photographer; the quality of the dozens of photos of aircraft, personnel, base facilities, and other subjects included in his book equals or surpasses many of those taken by professional photographers.  Readers with an interest in aircraft nose art will be especially pleased with the fine selection of such artwork that Mr. Gallagher has chosen to share with us.  This reviewer found only one noticeable mistake in the book: its title.  Technically speaking, there was no such organization as the `Fifth Army Air Force'.  The correct designation was simply the `Fifth Air Force', which was one of 16 numbered air forces in the AAF during World War II.  However, this minor glitch in no way detracts from the overall excellence of Mr. Gallagher's book.  Highly recommended!"
673,0470540931,4,"Jeffrey Tumlin's \\""Sustainable Transportation Planning\\"" is a very serviceable introduction to the area of transportation planning. He places this within the broader context of overall urban planning. The book's back cover states this work uses \\""clear, nontechnical language\\"" which is mostly true. Jargon, especially abbreviations, are necessary evils for works like this. Thus, the book does gently introduce the reader to new terminology and establishes a vocabulary for future study in this field. Overall, the vocabulary is directed towards people who may never have studied urban planning or transportation at all.<br /><br />The lavish illustrations and graphs are a strength of this book, serving to illuminate the text. This book primarily establishes the framework of the entire field of transportation planning. The book's sections serve as nice leaping off points for discussion. Chapter 10, \\""Parking,\\"" is a good example of the author setting the table, then leaving it to the reader to do further research in deciding which of his \\""Top Ten Parking Management Strategies\\"" are most important. The issues are stated, but only addressed shallowly.<br /><br />Rather than a traditional bibliography, chapter 15's \\""For More Information\\"" serves the same purpose. Most of the listed sources are online, usually federal government based (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency) and appear to be spot on. Additionally, the endnotes section, divided up by chapter, is also an excellent resource for further research.<br /><br />I take one star off (out of 5) primarily for the disappointing \\""Case Studies\\"" sprinkled throughout the work. These are usually just single paragraphs stating little useful information. \\""Case Study: San Diego Trolley\\"" (p. 117) basically says that a lot of people ride the system even though it is incomplete. The entire \\""case study\\"" is one paragraph. These are not what I would call traditional case studies. Second, there is little to no coverage of simulations, modeling, and computer algorithms. This book should be seen as an overview of the field, and not as a resource for current practicing urban and transportation planners.g, and computer algorithms.

674,0765325608,4,"I really enjoyed this book. As an avowed Austenite, I love books that take me into a similar world ... but I'm sick to death of the cookie-cutter Regency rip-off books. The \\""glamour\\"" twist on the concept here is a great deal of fun. I loved examining the characters as I read, trying to find the Austen archetypes, and enjoying how the author both paid homage to them (the severe Darcy-esque glamourist whose reserve hints at deeper emotions), and also tweaked them a bit (nothing plays out quite as you expect). It's a subtly different yet effective addition to the Regency canon.<br /><br />To those who are critcising this -- look, it's no DR. STRANGE AND MR. NORRELL. That's an epic masterpiece, a huge tome of a book that creates a deeply detailed alternate world. This is a lot lighter, and the magic here doesn't affect the fabric of the characters' everyday life in the same way it did in that book. But that kind of book doesn't come around every day. (And it takes about a week to read!) This is lighter, but it's also effective and fun.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are a person who, like me, has read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE about 25 times ... you will get an afternoon's enjoyment out of this book. Read it!"
675,0471756148,5,A chapter from this book was given to our class so we could compare it to our actual text. This book had better examples and the information flowed better than our textbook. Overall I would recommend this book over because I loved how well it linked the subject to what I'll be doing in the future.
676,0399252509,5,"Before the moon Laurel was a normal girl. A girl who had dreams and aspirations of one day becoming a writer. A girl who had friends and family. But that was before. Before Hurricane Katrina. Before her, her daddy, and younger brother Jessie left to go stay with her aunt. Before the water washed away her home. Before the water washed away her mamma and grandmamma. Before life as she knew it ended.<br /><br />But when new boyfriend T-Boom turns Laurel onto Moon a new life opens up to her. A life she never knew was possible. Feeling higher than life, the moon allows her to move forward and to forget the past.<br /><br />Her new life means forgetting. Forgetting the past, the people she loves and who love her, forgetting herself. Is Laurel strong enough to shake her habit, or will she die before she has the chance to?<br /><br />Written by acclaimed author Jacqueline Woodson, Beneath a Meth Moon is a gut-wrenchingly painful, yet beautiful examination of addiction.<br /><br />Just under two hundred pages Woodson's has brought the life and struggles of a meth addict to light. These struggles aren't pretty, they are gritty and often ugly. These struggles aren't easy, they're ruthless and full of frightful emotions. These struggles, as Woodson presents them, are startlingly realistic.<br /><br />Woodson's writing is sharp and purposeful. Beyond that there is a poetic quality to her writing. And even though as hopeless as Laurel's story is, there is a hopeful tone to the overall book. As the story bounces from one point in time to a completely different, unrelated point, readers won't only understand Laurel's life as a meth addict, but will come to appreciate the brutal honesty in which her story is told.<br /><br />Laurel, who's often portrayed as weak due to her crippling meth addiction, is a strong character. Not just strong, but memorable. Reader's will carry her story with them, in the minds and hearts long after the book has ended. At first glance Laurel often appearshelpless, lost, and weak. But the perseverance that lives inside of her makes her a powerful character that is determined to make a better life for herself dispite her problems.<br /><br />Beneath a Meth Moon is a one of a kind book. Reader's will appreciate Woodson's delicate handling of the subject matter, and will applaud her honesty."

678,1250009146,3,I enjoyed the book but there was no new info on the case that we hadn't heard before. The view's of the author are fairly one-sided.
679,0062107968,2,"This story moved very slowly and every time it would start to gain some momentum and get a little interesting, it would switch to another storyline. There were so many subplots and characters that were unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story except for unanswered questions and loose ends. I thought that the Selkies folklore was going to add an interesting twist but there was so little information and background about them that I had to wonder what the point was in introducing them to the story. This story doesn't flow, is underdeveloped and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The ending is a bad one that left me thinking, \\""that's it?!\\"" I was hoping to love this book, but instead I felt disappointed."
680,1884097456,5,"In writer, Harold Jaffe's OD, death looms in the margins. Instead of exploiting the deaths of each of the figures in the book, Jaffe meticulously reconfigures their lives into short narratives in a way that is both caricacture and homage. Aspects of each character's lives are deciphered and teased out in threads. Like a rogue taxidermist or some mirthful forensic historian, Jaffe pulls the raw strands of narrative DNA from figures like Lady Day, Edgar Allen Poe and Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />Through the centrifugal force of his prose, Jaffe exposes and 'treats' each accordingly, illuminating new perspectives. Most notably, the chapter on Edgar Allen Poe is a delirious, hallucinogenic journey through an urban landscape that resolves in a dervish-like dance in a crowded ballroom. His subject is reanimated in the present with a mind from the past and makes erudite observations that are both humorous and terrible and OD is terribly humorous.<br /><br />Walter Benjamin, Abbie Hoffman, Diane Arbus and Philip Rothko along with Bela Legosi, Jean Seberg and Jim Jones are each evaluated for their contributions to the culture. Jaffe renders them with surgical precision, finding seams, planting mines and slipping away. To be sure, his prose is subversive. Yet it is filtered through a careful, introspective and dialectic approach.<br />OD serves as a cogent reminder that those who operate outside the tenets of official culture--their time compressed and abbreviated by excess--have left us with an indelible legacy as has Jaffe with his evocative narrative."
681,098300644X,5,"Ben Parris does not disappoint! Having enjoyed his historical fantasy \\""Wade of Aquitaine\\"" I was curious to see what he could do with Science Fiction. The premise was unique and inspired - a series of intigues surrounding the 2038 Olympic games held on Mars. The science is well-thought-out but not overwhelming. A large cast of characters, well-drawn, play out their roles with precision and few mis-steps. Overall, a very good story well told. Highly recommended."

683,0515150630,5,"I loved this book and am honestly a bit surprised by a lot of the negative reactions.  I loved how strong and capable Rowan was, I loved Gull, all of it.  I find it interesting that this book has received some criticism for being so detailed in the job and such; however, that is one of Nora Robert's strengths as a writer, the research she does not only for locations but for the jobs she writes about.  I pick up her books and I learn so much about being a smoke-jumper, or someone who rehabs houses, or owns a villa, or paints/sculpts.  She is just so good at creating these new worlds with strong and relatable characters.  She does not give them angst for the sake of angst, like so many other authors do. In less capable hands, the characters would have been two-dimensional versions of a person we've already read about.  Instead, Nora takes familiar tropes and makes them new again.  I recommend this book highly to those who have an attention span beyond an 8 year old."

If you are looking for a real touch and feel book, do NOT get this one. Each page has the same texture (satin fabric, usually as a cape).  I love the Dwell studio touch and feel books if that's what you're looking for."

689,1470045346,5,"I decided to take a chance and read 'Goodly Creatures' despite its serious theme.  I got great pleasure out of this story and have rarely felt as uplifted by a conclusion.  This Elizabeth Bennet is strong, funny, loving and intelligent despite living since 15 with fear, guilt and loss.  Her need to survive is exhibited shortly after she is violated.  That allowed me to believe early on that she had the right stuff to find happiness.  Mr. Darcy is a survivor of another sort.  He struggles to overcome the loss of both parents and having to take on a great deal of responsibility at an early age.  That reality caused him to make some decisions he regrets, but he is a good man who would not think of acting selfishly or choosing a dishonorable path.  Though he judges Lizzy harshly for extorting money from her betters, he also feels compassion for her obvious loss of joy.  As with the original 'Pride and Prejudice', both have a lot to overcome in order to accomplish a happy-ever-after.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the Bennet family in 'Goodly Creatures.'  The 'deviation' from Austen's plot forced them to improve.  To me they have the same personalities but a sad event has diverted their paths for the better.<br /><br />I loved their letters to each other.  The lists were very romantic."

I know from experience a range of easily prepared yet inspiring vegetables on the table every night is delightful. The ideas for this however are not at all simple to obtain.<br />I am quite happy about the lack of pretty pictures. So much information is needed that there simply isn't room, and this book educates about substance rather than presentation.<br />But why only 4 stars?<br />Well I don't think a 5 star vegetable cookbook has been written yet.<br />In the past vegetable recipes have been a haphazard affair with some happy discoveries, but a failure to be really systematic.<br />So what is needed is a systematic re-examination of vegetables from the ground up, yet incorporating the happy discoveries of previous cooks with modern health and creativity added.  Jack's book doesn't quite get there and would really need to be doubled in size to achieve this task.<br />The style of the majority of recipes involves the development of flavours with olive oil and browning techniques, but there are many other techniques I would enjoy seeing more fully developed, such as creative variations, hot or cold salads, oil-less recipes, use of a full palette of spices, and health discoveries such as dressings with flax seed oil."

In this romantic story, a combination of the best of mail-order bride and governess themes, Bridget takes on the responsibility of two children left motherless. The father, William Black, is a good man but a distant parent who guards his heart. Bridget is nursing her own guarded heart so the course of their romance had this reader sighing with pleasure, nodding, smiling and even gasping in surprise a time or three!<br /><br />It is the mark of an excellent middle book in a trilogy when you read it FIRST and find yourself engaged by the current love story, then ordering the first book in the series and longing for the release of the conclusion.

700,0435900668,4,"A very well written novel. The way it compares two different cultures is brilliant.<br /><br />He pictured how women are exploited in different cultures. And he is absolutely right how we treat women in third world countries which is very sad.<br /><br />But the other thing noticeable is that women in western societies are facing different kind of problems. The destructiveness of failed/unhappy relations is evident (which is present in both cultures one way or another)..<br /><br />The impact of western culture on people who come from third world countries, as described in this book, is somewhat wrong. He made Moustafa look like a villain. And does his experiences in western world changed him? I don't think so... in the beginning writer portrayed him as someone free from feelings of admiration and envy... and I think he showed the same coldness in all his relations.. he cant be blamed for the lives of those poor girls.<br /><br />But I like the way he depicted the simplicity shown in the life of Sudan.

702,0615558666,4,"Nails Jane is a bit like a multimedia experience in the form of a novel. There are illustrations, verse, multiple first person points of view, and some parts of the plot can seem a little sketchy, but overall Nails Jane is an enjoyable first effort. It's cinematic, but personal.<br /><br />If you like dark and dystopian science fiction and if you can appreciate an author willing to take chances with her art, then you should really purchase and read this book.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the story four of five stars is because the non-traditional plot and the pacing at times robbed me of complete story immersion. Sometimes authors use additional material in a book to make up for the lack in story substance. That was not Trista DiGiuseppi's issue. I personally think she tried to explore too much. Many of the ideas didn't get adequate exploration.

704,0312621353,5,"At the end of the first book, Glow, Waverly had returned to her spaceship, the Empyrean with the girls, but was unable to rescue their parents from the New Horizon ship.  Now, Waverly spends her time repairing farm machinery and not talking to anyone.  She feels bad enough about not succeeding in rescuing their parents, but the kids blame her too.<br /><br />Kieran has taken command of the ship as Captain and seems to be doing an okay job, but he doesn't like to share in the power.  It's his way or no way.  He also thinks that everyone should attend his prayer lectures.  He's stowed Seth in the brig and hasn't even had a trial for him.  He's guilty for mutiny and that's that.  When he finds out that Seth has escaped, he blames Waverly.<br /><br />Kieran has the whole crew believing that Seth and Waverly are working together to take over the ship.  Seth investigates on his own, as he can staying hidden, and with some clever ideas, convinces Kieran that there is a stowaway from the New Horizon on board, intent on sabatage.<br /><br />When the Empyrean takes some direct hits, Kieran knows he must work quickly to rescue their parents or he will lose his position.  He hates Seth and Waverly and is determined to prove they are in cahoots with the enemy. Waverly is torn between her old relationship with Kieran and her friendship with Seth.  Who is right and who will save them all before it's too late?<br /><br />Spark is a thrilling page-turner that kept me enthralled.  I love the attention to detail and the characters.  The world-building is easy to envision and really brings the story to life.  Some of the situations are nail-biting and others having this reader curious to how the author would maneuver the characters as the plot twisted and turned.  What I didn't like was the huge cliff-hanger at the end!! Now I must wait months to find out what happens next.  Don't miss this one - I loved it!"

707,0801013984,5,"Josh James Riebock in his new book, \\""Heroes and Monsters\\"" published by Baker Books gives us An Honest Look at the Struggle within All of Us .<br /><br />From the Inside Flap:  Heroes and Monsters is an unforgettable memoir of passion and redemption, a ragged look into a world at once wildly twisted and profoundly beautiful, an expos&eacute; of both the hero and the monster within all of us.<br /><br />In this stunningly honest, thoroughly unconventional, and ultimately hopeful book, Josh James Riebock explores issues that form us  into the people we are-issues of family, love, intimacy, dreams, grief, purpose, and the unexpected stops along the journey. With artful prose and vivid storytelling, he shows that pain and beauty are so inextricably linked that to lose the former costs us the latter.<br /><br />If you're grappling with life's inconsistencies and trials,<br />if you're searching for an encounter with something real,<br />if you're craving a story that's just a wee bit odd . . .<br /><br />Heroes and Monsters is a fresh and exhilarating perspective on the uneven nature of life and the equally uneven people who inhabit it.<br /><br />The Bible tells us that there is nothing that is not common to man.  Our parents die, we face financial setbacks and all manners of crisis.  It seems like it is happening to just us as we live through it but, in reality, the rest of mankind has endured through the same situation or worse.  It is how we handle the situations that define us.  Are we hero or monster?<br /><br />Josh James Riebock tells us his story, not all of it pretty, but the storytelling is perfect.  While we are living through his experiences we can find ourselves in there as well.  Just like Josh we can find God and we can see if, in this situation, we will be a hero or monster.

708,034551128X,5,"In my opinion, the most important missing links of the Star Wars mythos surround Darth Plagueis and the rise of Palpatine. This book does an amazing job of setting the back story for many of the characters that we see in the movies. The political aspect of this novel is nothing short of intriguing. There are ruthless backstabbing, power plays and back room deals that may seem a bit blase on the surface, but really sets the tone for how incredibly brilliant both Plagueis and Palpatine are, though those who have a distaste for politics may find the novel less enjoyable. This is truly one of the most well written and fascinating Expanded Universe novels of this generation, and a smooth read at that. Highly recommended."
709,1440533148,1,"First, it's off-balance to sell a book called Renegades and only include interviews with male subjects. There are plenty of women who are renegades in their own right. However, I realize that this is Robert Ward's book and he may not have interviewed any women.<br /><br />About the book, like a few of the other reviewers, I found it to be uneven. Few of the interviews reveal anything new about the subjects, although there is a level of intimacy present in the writing. Some of the interviewees seem to send a pitiful message about alcoholism and misogyny.<br /><br />It just wasn't a book I enjoyed, and I struggled to finish it in order to post this review. The cover says \\""outrageous,\\"" but I say heavy-handed and obvious. If you like reading about men with huge egos and insecurities to accompany them, this is for you."

713,B0058M7N8M,5,"Lars is a young polar bear who lives in the Arctic and is out hunting with his father.  That night, they make piles of snow to protect themselves from the wind.  But during the night, the ice begins to crack and Lars's piece breaks off.  When he wakes up, he is all alone in the middle of the sea, and as the temperature grows warmer, his piece of ice is melting.  He manages to climb on top of a floating barrel; then a storm hits, and he keeps drifting until he comes to a tropical island where he meets a hippopotamus named Henry and an eagle named Marcus.  They are nice, but Lars wants to go home.  How can Henry and Marcus help Lars?  And will the little polar bear ever see his father again?<br />  Several years ago we rented for our weekly family video a full-length 2001 animated Warner Brothers movie The Little Polar Bear based on this book written and illustrated by Dutch author Hans de Beer, who was born in 1957.  Of course, the film version is a lot different with many more plot features than are contained in the simple children's picture book, which is a lovely story for youngsters about going different places and experiencing new things but desiring to get back with family.  It is well told with bits of subtle humor and detailed pastel illustrations.  A board book edition (1999) is available for toddlers, but be forewarned that it is severely abridged, a fact that is not clearly indicated on the back of the book.  Other \\""Little Polar Bear Adventures\\"" by de Beer are Ahoy There, Little Polar Bear; Little Polar Bear Finds a Friend; Little Polar Bear and the Brave Little Hare; Little Polar Bear and the Husky Pup; Little Polar Bear and the Big Balloon; Little Polar Bear and the Reindeer; and Little Polar Bear and the Whales."
714,0980662907,5,"Ancient philosophers often stated that there can be no personal or spiritual growth without pain. Suffering and anguish, we are told, are the brutal conduits to enlightenment; they are the catalysts to inner-questioning, exploration, and ultimately, metamorphosis. Pain and suffering force us to face cold hard truths and help define our ethics.<br /><br />I am no stranger to pain. As a filmmaker since 1990, I have documented thousands of individual medical nightmares. In truth, I have seen too much...and felt too much hurt. So the prospect of reading about another personal train wreck...another tale of tragedy and heartbreak made me wary. Within the opening pages of Sarah's Last Wish, however, Eve's Hillary's powerful writing immersed me into the world of 11-year old Sarah Westley, a young girl diagnosed with ovarian cancer. . .and there was no turning back.<br /><br />Sarah's Last Wish is a transformative book, a passionate homage to millions of people harmed by conventional medical institutions. But is also a prayer to return freedom and humanity back to healthcare worldwide.<br /><br />Sarah's Last Wish shares not only the pain, but the Light that was Sarah, whose childlike, if not Godlike wisdom haunts us with the reminder that the smallest voices can offer the most profound lessons.<br /><br />As we debate how to create not only a better healthcare system, but a better world, Sarah's Last Wish offers lessons on how our medical systems must change if we are to ever truly reach societal enlightenment. It asks whether we are humane enough to hear the gracious wisdom of an 11-year old girl...and whether we are willing act to preserve all we hold dear about humanity itself."

When I started looking at the cake recipes, they seemed strange to me compared to other cakes I have made.  They had a lot more eggs and way less sugar and other liquid compared to the amount of flour, but I decided to give them I go anyway.  They came out tasting like barely sweet, dense, dry biscuits. We were dissapointed to say the least & ended up making a mad dash to the grocery store to get more eggs to make a cake recipe out of my Betty Crocker cookbook (which, btw was very good.) All in all, to much work for bad tasting cupcakes.<br /><br />But the designs are cute & my 4 year old was able to put the decorations on the 'smore' cupcake by herself (after I frosted it), so it does get younger kids more involved than typical cake decorating allows."

As a writer, you'll want to aim for a style that moves forward quickly and emphasizes voice.\\""<br /><br />An updated and expanded version of Victoria Hanley's 2008 book, this edition of Wild Ink is certain to become the basic reference for beginning and aspiring writers of Young Adult fiction and non-fiction. Beginning with an introduction to the YA genre, Hanley answers common questions about appropriate word count, use of slang, and subject matter, then advances to subgenre classifications and market trends. A chapter on writing YA non-fiction follows an excellent two-part workshop on novel-writing.<br /><br />Most writers, including those who have been published in other genres, will benefit from the chapters on \\""Obstacles and Demons\\""--the excuses writers use and the roadblocks that make them stumble on their way to a finished manuscript. Hanley's writing exercises as well as her section on \\""Resources for Writers\\"" will be as helpful to the experienced author as the beginner. Many of the references cited apply to all genres and audiences.<br /><br />When Hanley moves on to discuss \\""Submitting Your Manuscript,\\"" she includes information about agents and editors, agent interviews, multiple submissions, and things/scams to watch out for. There is also excellent coverage of both traditional publishing versus self-publishing. The discussion of marketing is enhanced by interviews with marketing specialists.<br /><br />The final section of Wild Ink features interviews with YA authors writing in a wide range of subgenres. Hanley has updated this section, as well as many of the examples used throughout the book, to include recently published writers, providing the reader with a current view of today's YA audience and trends.<br /><br />Victoria Hanley is an award-winning YA novelist published in 13 languages. She is a popular instructor at writing workshops in Northern Colorado and at writing conferences.<br /><br />An advance reading copy of Wild Ink was supplied by Prufrock Press Inc. for this review."

It may seem funny to call it \\""inspirational\\"" since it is very critical of the mainstream common perceptions of how things work--maybe \\""bracing\\"" is a better term.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of a perfect 5 is that the author is not a professional narrator, so the different characters are sometimes hard to distinguish.  Also, a minor structural quibble for naming two different characters with similar names: Josh and Jason, which is probably less a problem in print than in spoken/audio where my mind jumps ahead, and mixes up the characters."

This book is about globalization and its affect on the world, from the largest trade markets in the world to the daily lives of people around the globe. Telling the story of globalization from the perspective of a small, isolated place that nearly no one has heard of seems an impossible feat, but Mr. Wright has accomplished just that.

Part of his job was to combat counterfeiters, and the story of Newton tracking one particular counterfeiter is the basis of this book.  The author makes much of Newton's dogged pursuit of his quarry and his ruthlessness in condemning this man to jail.  There seems to be general surprise that Newton could be so practical and determined.

738,1451657471,3,"I have been eagerly anticipating reading Roberta Rich's The Midwife of Venice for months now, being completely enthralled by Venice at the moment and eager to explore it in fiction as well as non-fiction.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and found the two main characters, wife and husband, Hannah and Isaac Levi, and their story interesting.  I definitely liked how Rich incorporated 16th century Venetian and Jewish terms info their narrative, and the glossary at the end was helpful but not really necessary as she did a good job of explaining terms in context.<br /><br />However, this was a quick read.  In fact, that's my issue with the book and why I gave it only 3 stars on my GoodReads review.  The novel is too short for the story that Rich wants to tell. With the exception of only a few scenes, it reads mostly as a detailed synopsis rather than a rich, deeply layered, complex story of a different world.<br /><br />Hannah is a midwife, but we only see her deliver one baby. She is a lifelong resident of the Jewish ghetto in Venice, but we only see her interact with one person from the ghetto, her rabbi.  Her scenes with her estranged sister, Jessica, are told with breakneck speed, and there's no time to get to know Jessica as we attempt to understand what drove her to live as she did.  I'm not a particularly skeptical reader--I tend to believe what a narrator tells me about a character--but I can't get to know, love, empathize, and relate to a character when I don't see them and hear them but am only told about them.<br /><br />I would much rather have learned about Jessica and Isaac from the beginning--how did she become a midwife, was it uncommon for wives to work, how did Isaac feel about her work--and I don't mean just backstory narrative, I mean real scenes that grab you and make you feel what the characters are feeling.  Most importantly, I would have loved to read the scene in which she invented her birthing spoons, not just heard about it, briefly in flashback.  Again, one of the most interesting parts of the story was Hannah's ministrations to Tarzi, the Turkish woman who wanted to stop having so many babies.  The appeal of this story to me for lo these many months was partly Venice but also partly the whole midwifery stuff.<br /><br />And as for Isaac. I liked him, but again only superficially.  I know nothing about his work as a merchant of Venice.  I only got to see him as a prisoner on Malta, and then the story moved way too fast.  I would rather have seen him stay at the convent for a longer time, seen more of his life under evil Joseph's whip, and the growing relationship between him and the lovely artist, Gertrudis.  I loved the story of him rescuing the  boy on the ship, but I hated the fact that I really have no idea what happened to him after he jumped off the boat.<br /><br />The speed of the narrative undermines the \\""willing suspension of disbelief\\"" that is essential for a reader to believe a story.  Without having a plethora of detailed, realistic, conversation-laden scenes in which I can  immerse myself in a story, the holes in the fabric become glaring and troubling.  I've been looking forward to reading this story for months, and I got through the book in three days.  A Diana Gabaldon novel takes me a good month, or at least a couple of weeks if I put all my other reading aside!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to Rich telling more of Hannah and Isaac's story as they journey to Constantinople, but I hope she slows down and writes a much longer book.  Her story and her characters deserve it.Again, one of the most interesting parts of the story was Hannah's ministrations to Tarzi, the Turkish woman who wanted to stop having so many babies.  The appeal of this story to me for lo these many months was partly Venice but also partly the whole midwifery stuff.<br /><br />And as for Isaac. I liked him, but again only superficially.  I know nothing about his work as a merchant of Venice.  I only got to see him as a prisoner on Malta, and then the story moved way too fast.  I would rather have seen him stay at the convent for a longer time, seen more of his life under evil Joseph's whip, and the growing relationship between him and the lovely artist, Gertrudis.  I loved the story of him rescuing the  boy on the ship, but I hated the fact that I really have no idea what happened to him after he jumped off the boat.<br /><br />The speed of the narrative undermines the \\""willing suspension of disbelief\\"" that is essential for a reader to believe a story.  Without having a plethora of detailed, realistic, conversation-laden scenes in which I can  immerse myself in a story, the holes in the fabric become glaring and troubling.

739,0142413704,1,"When a book causes girls to blush and look embarrassed I am immediately wary.  I am a teacher, mother, and older sister and I would never recommend this book.  Why when our society claims to be empowering women do we praise a book in which a girl is overjoyed to win back a boyfriend who is quicker to kiss than make sure she's okay.  Really??  If that's empowering women then I'm lost.<br /><br />Finally, girls are being exposed to more and more sexuality at earlier ages.  Why?  And if you say, \\""They'll have to come across it one day so don't be prudish and just throw it into a kids books without any respect for it\\""  you greatly misunderstand the psych-y and needs of young women.  Yes, they will need to \\""hear about sex at some point\\"" but only with proper respect to the subject and the listener.<br /><br />I highly discourage any books by this author."
740,0316084778,4,"The story follows Chrysabelle as she is trying to leave the service of vampire nobility. After being refused the option of leaving her patron at her century party, she finds her patron dead. That knowledge is her chance a freedom. The death of her patron means he no longer owns her blood rights. After growing up in the business, she relies on her former comarre aunt to help her in kine -- human -- society. Sending her to a contact, Chrysabelle ends up meeting Mal. Through various events, they find themselves sneaking into Corviniestri -- the headquarters of vampire society -- to stop a plot that could lift the veil between vampires and mortals.<br /><br />Reading this book, it is easy to see how Anne Rice and Vampire: The Masquerade has shaped our modern perceptions of vampires. From the houses and powers attributed to a specific house to the drinking of vampire blood to become undead, one has to wonder whether we will ever see a new vampire. That is not to say, however, that Meyers has added to the genre or species. I would be remiss to say so. Even with pulling on the giants that have come before, Painter did make an effort to make the vampires her own. I thought the concept of a comarre was quite interesting. Add to that the trained and hardened vampire killing side brings the story up to a new level. The idea that vampires -- nobility no less -- are sustained by some of the only people trained to kill them is itself a beautiful irony. Even though the comarre training is a deeply guarded secret, one has to wonder if the vampires are so easily kept in the dark -- pun not intended. Without the full knowledge of the comarre training, wouldn't allowing a comar or comarre their freedom after 100 years cause some to pause? Living so closely with humans means that they would gain some knowledge whether intimate or not. And I'm not talking about sex. Whatever you think, drinking blood is an intimate act! That aside, the vampire, while spoiling their major food source, either has great trust in their comar/comarre or they are completely lost in their arrogance and refuse to face reality.<br /><br />Looking at Aunt Maris, I wonder why the vampires choose to allow their food source an option of leaving. Further, if they tire of their property, why do they not trade it or kill them?<br /><br />And, I'm not sorry to say it, the mopey, tall-dark-and-handsome, Byronic hero vampires are getting on my nerves! I want a vampire that doesn't apologize for what it is! I'm tired of this constant identity crisis! And no more vegetarian vampires. Come on people, it was already done -- masterfully I might add -- with Louis. To get right down to it, I want Lestat -- or something similar. I want a ruthless, cold-blooded killer. A predator that is able to seamlessly camouflage themselves to attract more prey. Why are vampires sexy, emit this bestial mystique that drive humans crazy? For the same reason angler fish have a phosphorescent light: to attract prey! While I understand romanticizing vampires to a point, I think we've essentially castrated them with all of the \\""noble savage\\"" mentality that can be seen in modern literature. Granted, I understand that living for centuries watching people die will take a toll on anyone, but when is enough enough?<br /><br />You want to see a real vampire, read LeFanu's Carmilla which predates Dracula.<br /><br />Let's get serious here, people, would you knowingly sleep with something that desires -- no, wait, something that NEEDS to kill you in order to survive? In real life, do you see prey snuggle up to the predator? Did Bundy's victims knowingly fawn all over him and willingly spread their legs? Hell no! Why, then, do we assume that the vampire won't kill you? Honestly, that's one of the things I appreciate about the Dresden Files: Butcher tells it like it is.<br /><br />Given the nature of vampires in modern society, I did find myself enjoying this book. At the beginning, I found myself having a hard time engaging. Usually, if it takes a book more than a few pages to grab my attention, I found myself pushing through because I wanted to know what would happen. However, the relationship between Mal and Chrysabelle was entirely too predictable. the same can be said of the Mal and Tatiana's relationship. Even though it is not said outright, I saw it coming a mile away. That being said, however, I found myself enjoying Tatiana. She did tend to be stupid and allow her hubris to blind her, but she knew what she was.<br /><br />Because I forced myself to continue plowing through the book, I did find a gem under the predictable characters, relationships, and plot devises. By the end of the book, I am willing to give this book four skulls.aging.

741,1434912183,4,"I am fascinated with anything historical in time. Whether it is from the US or another country, I just crave to learn more about the historical way of life, customs, etc. That is one of the reasons I was drawn to this book aside from the mysterious woman on the cover. It promised a great love story, suspense, and the chance to learn of historical customs in China.<br /><br />This book didn't turn out to be what I thought it would be. There are a lot of events that disturbed me in this novel, and if you surprise easily I wouldn't recommend it. One of the most disturbing to me was Prince Yin-jeng's sexual encounters with young boys. I couldn't hardly stomach the details in which the events were explained, even though that is how things were done in imperial court back then. All in all I felt it was a very sad novel, and I was very upset by the ending. I felt the book focused on more carnage than anything. Without spoiling the novel I will just say that there was no way I could have at all predicted how things would turn out for our characters so the unpredictability of the novel was what kept me reading. The one thing I did like about this novel is Opal Moon's will to overcome all obstacles thrown her way. Having been abandoned by her mother at a young age and raised by foster parents serving as their maidservant, she had to learn at a young age to be independent and diligent. This shows through her character and it was easy to admire her at times despite her young age. Even though she succumbed to her passions with Prince Yin-chen eventually, and despite her ardent Christian beliefs she continued to try to do the right thing. The problem arose when there became too many obstacles for her to try and overcome all alone and instead of seeking wiser help she tried to take things into her own hands.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone under the age of eighteen due to sexually graphic/disturbing content. Despite the fact that this novel wasn't quite what I expected it was very well researched, and very well written. I was hooked in by Opal Moon, and I couldn't wait to see how things would turn out for her in the end.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I received a complimentary copy of this book for review as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team.

743,1937007448,4,"Prepare to say a fond farewell to Sookie Stackhouse, because \\""Deadlocked\\"" is the penultimate volume of the Southern Vampire series.<br /><br />But even if there's only one more book, the twelfth book about the telepathic waitress and her vampire and/or were connections is a pretty solid one. It's a rather sad book in places, since Sookie's relationship to Eric seems to be cracking into pieces, but it has that lovable balance of unpretentious Southernness mixed with vampire/were stuff.<br /><br />A conference between Felipe and Eric goes horribly awry when a young woman (whom Eric had taken blood from) is found dead outside Eric's home. Unsurprisingly, Sookie and Eric are both suspects, and Sookie suspects that Eric is keeping something from her. Even odder, her death is linked to the fae -- and Sookie is sure that she was hired to lure Eric.<br /><br />As she juggles family matters, a nosy were, a birth and a forthcoming wedding, Sookie also starts investigating the girl's death. She also has some other problems to deal with, like a stranger's interest in the cluviel dor and the arrival of a vampire queen who wants Eric. But unraveling these conspiracies will reveal some of the nastiest betrayals Sookie has ever encountered.<br /><br />As always, Charlaine Harris' writing is like slipping into a soft, well-worn sweater that smells vaguely of magnolia trees. There's just something very pleasant and homey about her prose, and this novel is somewhat smoother than the last few book -- the narrative can switch fluidly from descriptions of the fairy world to \\""House Hunters International.\\"" Trippy.<br /><br />However, \\""Deadlocked\\"" has a sharply bittersweet flavor as well, with Sookie finding out the hard way that lots of people can leave you heartbroken (not just lovers!). A few parts of the book are depressing, particularly since Sookie's relationship with Eric is clearly crumbling -- she even admits that while the sex is great (not that we see any), they're not doing so well emotionally.<br /><br />It also has the feeling of a transition book -- lots of people are getting engaged and producing babies, and a few actually leave. Harris seems to be wrapping up various ongoing subplots, including a massive one close to Sookie's own heart.<br /><br />So unsurprisingly this is a wrenching novel for Sookie. She's still a tough, confident woman, but she also has to grapple with the semi-conscious knowledge that her romance with Eric is under attack, and that people may be trying to get to the cluviel dor. Eric is strangely distant in this story even when he appears; Sam seems to have taken a more central role.

744,1937007448,3,"-----SOME SPOILER ALERTS-----<br /><br />The much anticipated Sookie Stackhouse book is finally out, but I'm disappointed with the result. It seems that the author does not take the time to write the beloved books like she did in the first half of the series. After reading the last five or so books in a relatively short period, I've become annoyed with all the repetitive scenes the author keeps adding. If you notice Sookie makes a whole lotta coffee, sings badly in her car and talks about books she picks up from the library.<br /><br />In this particular book, I was not happy how so many questions were left unanswered. Its pretty much up in the air on who she may end up with in the end...Bill or Eric. In my opinion I hope it is Bill.  Plus, I've never been a big fan of the whole Fae aspect Sookie is involved in. Don't care for Niall, or Claude or Dermont, none of them. It was better when it was just vampires and shifters. And, oh my god how many more bodies is she going to have to deal with? I'm surprised her house is not filled with the ghosts of the people or supes she has been responsible for killing, since they all took place on her property. Another person is disposed of in her kitchen and it is just too much. I'd have had a breakdown if my place was surrounded by so much death, and my nights would be filled with nightmares. I don't think she has much of a conscience anymore.<br /><br />The book is suspenseful in some parts, still ok all around, but not what the series used to be.<br /><br />The author better end this series with a huge bang, or I won't be recommending it to people anymore, at least not past the seventh book. I want f-ing fireworks for the final book!"

746,B007W69QXW,2,"Reason for Reading:  The book looked beautiful and sounded interesting.<br /><br />First off, let me say that I was not going to give this book a rating as I was flummoxed as to what I should rate it.  This has never happened to me before but then when I thought about it, not giving the book a rating was copping out.  My rating is like giving the book a 50%; I kind of feel like the right person would enjoy this book much more than I did and could deservedly give it a higher rating.<br /><br />The illustration is absolutely fantastic, stunning and what I appreciated about this book.  On illustration alone I would rate it a 5/5.  Each page is awesome and the book is printed in an over sized horizontal format to really emphasize the panoramic views.  Even though we are looking at insects here, they are up close and take on the aspects of an almost alien species.  If these were photographs, I'd be freaked out by the insects but these CG paintings are incredibly beautiful.<br /><br />As to the book's story.  It is in verse and to tell the truth I was utterly confused.  Here my rating would be a 0/5.  You can read the publisher's summary but from reading the words I had no idea what was going on.  Certain phrases and groups of words appealed to my sense of literature, but I am not a poetry person and could not find a story within the verse.  All I could tell was the beginning was happy, then the story turned very dark in the middle and finally became exhilarating at the end.  However, I do not read a book to receive random emotions.  I think the right person for this book must first be someone who appreciates unorthodox verse, then secondly will appreciate the illustration of that verse.  This was not my kind of book."

It gives the reader some basic facts about Jewish meditation, such as what meditation is, why one should meditate, as well as practical information on how one should go about meditating the Jewish way.  Too often, people think of meditation as something practiced by Eastern religions, such as Buddhism.  But Rabbi Kaplan makes clear that there is an established history of meditation in the Jewish tradition, which has been used by the Hasidim for centuries, specifically by the Breslov branch of Chassidism (they call it \\""Hitbodedut\\""), as well as by the Jewish prophets in the Tanach, who apparently used meditative techniques to attain their mystical prophecies.<br />This book is a great introduction to Rabbi Kaplan's other, more esoteric books on meditation, Meditation and the Bible, and Meditation and the Kabbalah (please see my reviews of both of these books).

Author Jim Lynch pondered these desires and put them in writing in a novel entitled The 2020 Players: A Futuristic Account of the 2020 Presidential Election Year.<br /><br />The 2020 Players is a futuristic story of the Presidential Election of 2020.

The sitting president is bound by a new amendment to the U.S. Constitution which limits her to a single, six-year term and must live under a provision which bans her from participating in politics while in office.<br /><br />The plot picks up quickly and becomes very fast-paced and unpredictable as it nears an end which leaves the reader hopeful and optimistic about the future of American politics - much needed feelings.

Pete Watts is a former undercover narcotics cop who got way too close to his job. He now runs a music rehearsal studio in which all manner of eccentric musicians come through. His soon to be ex-girlfriend is a talented singer with a sleazy manager who is in the habit of giving his clients drug habits, occasionally overdosing them to move their recordings up the charts, with the full support of the shady entertainment company for whom he works. This universe of people is inexorably drawn into a war between two violent drug gangs, viewed through the perspective of the Napoleonic leader of one gang. He has recently signed on a strange, but beautiful ex-mercenary, who wears makeup in the form of multi-colored tears running down her face. These tears are, in fact, decals on which different poisons are concealed, hence the title. Some survive the Trial of Tears, some don't. The story's taut climax is set in a posh townhouse in which only the courageous will emerge unscathed. While it certainly has its share of humor, action and suspense, it is also a story of friendship and redemption, as well as being a love letter to New York City.<br /><br />My Thoughts: This is going to be a tricky one - this book is a bit hard to define. The music industry, drug industry, organized crime, and a very strange woman with very strange make-up all intersect in this thriller. Among the main players: Pete is a former narcotics undercover officer who, after crashing and burning into drug addiction, now owns a small practice studio for musicians.

763,144240292X,4,"Any young lady with an imagination of her own will find the story of Sara Crewe delightful and enchanting. The rags to riches plot may not be original in and of itself, but the way Sara transforms her dirty quarters into something beautiful, all within her mind, feels almost magical. Her sweet care for Becky despite her own grief and pain is also a picture of selflessness and courage. She refuses to let her sad circumstances steal the joy she has always found in small things, proving that she can be the same sweet girl she was when she had everything money could buy. It's her heart, not her possessions that make her a little princes. The happily ever after ending makes Sara's story feel even more like a fairy tale.<br /><br />To read more of my book reviews and recommendations, visit larsenreviews.org."
764,1938257014,3,"Ellis Nelson's novel, Into the Land of Snows, though filled with interesting glimpses into Buddhist philosophy, was simply too preposterous a tale to swallow.  I do not say this because of the mention of aliens, yeti, and supernatural monks, which by far were the most interesting tidbits in the book; no, the hardest story to swallow was that the clichéd protagonist, Blake, a rebellious 16-year-old boy struggling with his parents' divorce, was sent to the Base Camp of Mount Everest, in the middle of the school year, to spend time with his father, after causing trouble for his mother back home in the States!<br />However, soon after arriving Blake is forced to leave after a tragic climbing disaster finally makes his father realize this is too dangerous a place for a child.  So, was the boy helicoptered to safety, after his parents realize the stupidity of their actions?  No!  He was told he had to hike down the Himalayas with his Sherpa guide and meet his dad in Katmandu some odd month later!  Seriously?!  Our poor protagonist has been gifted with the two most irresponsible & stupid parents on the face of the earth!<br />If it was necessary to get a 16-year-old boy to the Himalaya's in order to advance the plot of this novel, I would have hoped Ms. Nelson would have thought of a more realistic scenario for Blake's adventure.  With all this said, this book is mostly a rudimentary glimpse into Buddhist beliefs, as Blake's guide introduces him to this ancient religion on their way down the mountain toward Katmandu.  I found this part of the novel interesting enough to keep me reading; however, the boy's disrespectful, cavalier attitudes at times made even this rather tiresome.  The idea of incorporating real-life religious teachings into a work of fiction in order to teach young adults about values is not a bad idea; however, I found Ms. Nelson's execution toward this endeavor rather lacking in real substance."

774,1463443382,5,"To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1995 the Smithsonian Institution assembled an exhibition of photos and artifacts including the actual Army Air Forces bomber, the Enola Gay, which had dropped the bomb. A controversy arose when the museum planned to include some movie footage of the devastation taken soon after the explosion. The old black-and-white film had been shot from a moving vehicle and showed all too graphically the bodies of civilian victims lying along the street, mile after mile of charred and roasted human remains: women, children, senior citizens.<br /> Although this presentation of the stark reality of nuclear death would appear to be a critical centerpiece for an historic memorial of this importance, official objections to showing the long-suppressed film were persuasive enough to convince the Smithsonian curators to remove it from the display.<br /> In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes reports that the death toll from that August 6 explosion reached 140,000 by the end of 1945 and a total of 200,000 within five years, additional victims killed slowly by the effects of nuclear radiation.<br /> As the Holocaust has its deniers, there are those in the U.S. who would like to \\""cover up\\"" the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Of course it can't be covered up, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum bears all-too-powerful witness to the event, but they prefer the human element be downplayed, the raw suffering papered over.<br /> This turn-your-face-away attitude makes eyewitness survivors all the more important.<br /> A five-year-old girl who was there -- who was wounded, irradiated, and survived -- is here today to testify to the horror of the atomic bomb. Listen to her.<br /> Little Kikuko Furuta, her two brothers and their mother Masako were at home, about a mile from Ground Zero, when the blast occurred. The kitchen window exploded inward, spraying them with shards of broken glass as the house collapsed. Somehow Masako dug her children out of the rubble and they spent the next two weeks, bloody and sick, wandering among the dead and dying seeking medical attention, food and water.<br /> Her husband was killed in the blast and for nearly 50 years the widow Masako never spoke about the experience. Then, one day not long before she died, she told her daughter what happened.

Nevertheless, he's a cousin , so I'm probably positively biased.<br /><br />Peter is a remarkable person.  Not only a gifted writer, a diplomaed musician, an erstwhile songwriter, a Princeton graduate, a unique blend of social worker and management consultant who's worked on both sides of the Atlantic, but most importantly someone with an extremely strong and courageous personality (he even uses the word arrogant to describe his youth) which has permitted him to break all sorts of barriers.  Some of the barriers were physical due to his blindness, but most were social.<br /><br />The book's title announces the war of the barriers, but the content goes much further.<br /><br />The central incident of the book is his coupling with his fifth seeing eye dog.  He reveals to the reader, almost minute by minute, the process whereby man and dog establish the most initimate bond possible.<br /><br />The key feature of the book is the detail of his description of what goes on inside a blind person as he leads his normal life.  He invites the reader inside his self as he scrutinises, without visual sight, the world around him. He maintains a delicate balance, avoiding voyeurism, narcisssism and bad taste.  His honesty is overwhelming.<br /><br />Some readers may possibly find the detail tedious.  I let myself go, lapping up the detail, enjoying his writing style and cruising through the pages.

779,0312656734,3,"When I first grasped the novel in my hands, I have to admit that the summary on the back was not exactly my everyday reading topic of choice; suicide does not exactly bring joy to a person. However, after shuffling through a few pages, I began to admire the witty remarks made by Eddie and her view on her father's death. The way Eddie expressed her feelings had me giggling for moments at a time. This was probably the best part of the book, because everything after that brought no conclusion to the story's plot. When the clues left by Eddie's father came into play it seemed as though the novel was going to have an interesting ending; big ol' fail on that idea. The ending left me feeling absolutely drab and unsatisfied with the story. Bring Culler Evans into the story seemed like it could bring about some amusement. However, once the mystery revealed itself, Culler seemed annoying and unappealing rather than the unknown, sexy essence he supposedly withheld.  Overall this is not a book I would pick up again; sorry to rain on your parades Courtney Summer fans."

789,B005ZOJT76,5,"I was walking through Target last year, and noticed this title on the paperback book shelf; I was instantly amused and intrigued.  A fast look confirmed for me that I would definitely spend some time with Holly Robinson as she relived her childhood as the daughter of the premier gerbil supplier of all time.  As someone surrounded by animals since childhood (as but one example, I once awoke to the noise of breaking ornaments and found that when Santa brought the tree he left an iguana crawling around in it)and as a past farm kid and zookeeper, I could definitely relate to her memoirs.  When she was a child, her father, an ex-Navy officer, developed a fascination with gerbils that transcended simply keeping a couple of them as pets and became almost a way of life.  Holly's story about her experiences with her dad and growing up as a laborer who was conscripted into caring for 9000 gerbils was alternately fascinating and entertaining, and her descriptions do that wonderful thing that true writers strive to do:  instantly place the picture of what's being talked about in the mind of the reader.  An anecdote about having a friend over, and allowing two gerbils to make their escape through a gap under the garage door had me in stitches; the description of the gerbils having the appearance of tumbling leaves as they disappeared across the street could not have been worded more perfectly, and I laughed on and off for about an hour when that description kept floating back through my mind.  While she recalls being made fun of as a kid as the \\""rat girl,\\"" I instantly wished I had known her, because I could tell, just from the way she thinks and recounts her experiences, that we would have been the best of friends.<br /><br />I was so impressed with this book that I sent Holly an e-mail praising it.  I had never seen anything written by her before, and as it turns out this was her first published work.  She has continued to write (and in fact has a novel available at Amazon -- [[ASIN:1466404833 Sleeping Tigers]]) and has inspired me to possibly try setting down something about my own childhood and career as a caregiver of chimps and a longtime zookeeper, but I doubt that anything I write will compare to the mastery Holly Robinson showed in her memoirs.<br /><br />I unhesitatingly recommend this book to any with even a passing interest in animals in general.  For those who love stories of people who had a quirky upbringing, this book will definitely keep you entertained.  It's a charming remembrance, and deserved a place on my shelf.

792,0786851627,5,"I'd intended to leisurely preview this for my son to make sure it wasn't too violent. Instead it pulled me in and kept my eyes glued on its pages until 2 a.m. this morning... and I immediately bought Tentacles... at 2 a.m. (Gotta love online buying for that.)<br /><br />This book was like the Magic Treehouse kids all grown up and taking on Jurassic Park or Journey to the Center of the Earth. It begins with Grace and Marty at a boarding school for gifted or wealthy kids--and it's a great peek into their personalities. The author does an amazing job with presenting them as being kids like any other kids even while they're very unusual and interesting. Marty has a photographic memory, loves extreme adventures, and is curious beyond his control--and often gets into trouble for that. Grace is very, very intelligent but with a healthy dose of phobias. Their parents go missing on a photo-journalism expedition and they're sent to live with their uncle on Cryptos Island. After a few adventures on the island, the two kids are accidentally parachute-dropped into the Congo where the excitement ratchets up to the point that you only breathe every third page. Mambas, dinosaurs, and leeches... oh my.<br /><br />What stood out in this book is that while the kids were constantly getting into trouble or chaos--they were intelligent and recognition was paid to when they were disobeying the adults around them. Also, I genuinely liked these kids. As an adult reading kids' books, sometimes the characters annoy me. I just want to shake them and tell them to listen to the adults around them--especially when they put themselves in danger. I really liked Grace and Marty. Their personalities were fun and real and the relationship between them was really great to see in a modern-day book.<br /><br />Even though the technology in this is now over five years old, it's not dated. It still feels fairly cutting-edge. And the study of Cryptids (animals not scientifically proven to be in existence but reputed through myths) has a timeless draw on our minds among the young and old.<br /><br />For parents: I was surprised at how audience friendly this was. There was some violence and graphic descriptions but I would have read this aloud to my son starting at around age 7. No profanity. No adult situations. It was just an awesome adventure which I'm hoping continues in Tentacles. This book should be in every mid-grade kids' hands. It puts so many other books out there to shame. This is a book you can read aloud to your kids--and then sneak out and read ahead of them after they're in bed.<br /><br />My favorite line was on page 41: Marty whispered to Grace, \\""That's the kind of man who keeps squids in his library.\\""<br /><br />You've got to read this book. I swear you'll love it... or come find me and tell me what's wrong with you that you didn't."
793,1400069343,4,"Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake is the first book of Anna Quindlen's essays that I have read, and I'll admit I approached it with some trepidation. Many of the reviews were just so-so, and after reading (and loving) several of her novels, I did not want to read a so-so Anna Quindlen book. Not every one of the essays in this book spoke to me, but there were several (especially Stuff, Mothering, and Faith) that were so good that they more than make up for the rest.<br /><br />This book is touted by the publisher as a celebration of aging, and while Quindlen does write about getting older, it is not a precious collection of old-age aphorisms. There were several instances where I began to think that Quindlen might possibly have an easier and more comfortable time growing older than a woman in average circumstances who might not have a country place with a pond to walk around, or affordable healthcare, let alone a trainer who can help her with \\""the stories she tells herself.\\"" But Quindlen does not make apologies; she doesn't preach and she does write with honesty. One of the reasons I like Anna Quindlen's writing is that she makes me think, and she manages to do that here through wonderfully written and thoughtful prose.<br /><br />What comes across most to me is Quindlen's incredibly deep attachment to her children and to her job as a mother. This is where her writing really shines. She writes ideas that I've also thought about, but she expresses them infinitely better than I could manage myself.<br /><br />\\""Being a parent is not transactional. We do not get what we give.

794,0312576463,5,"I was initially ashamed that I found Patty and Richard's relationship to be the single most enthralling plot point in Jonathan Franzen's brilliant, best-selling novel \\""Freedom\\"".  Yet I realized that the relationships in this novel are akin to those in reality in that, like dominos, they can all fall as events play out.  Every thread in this expertly woven tapestry is just as important as the one sewn before it.  By the end of the novel, I felt as if my undeniable female urge for passionate romance was justified.  Every experience here holds equal weight in being depressing and thrilling, or hopeful and devastating.<br /><br />\\""Freedom\\"" is an updated \\""World According to Garp\\"", Richard in this novel being what Garp was to the other.  The characters are miserable but they mean well.  They try to turn their lives around, and things exponentially worsen.  We find reasons to both love and hate each person, perhaps because in them we can see so much of ourselves.<br /><br />Bonus points go out to Franzen for his inclusion of a Bright Eyes concert that spanned five or so pages of the novel.  I have been a fan of Bright Eyes for over six years now and, for the record, they put on one hell of a concert.  (You can see my review of one of their shows on Saddle Creek records' website at [...])  They, particularly frontman Conor Oberst, even received the deserved Franzen treatment in that they too were provided a back-story for those less familiar.  What perfect musical accompaniment to this story that is already dripping with emotional turmoil.  If this book is adapted into film, as it has been rumored to be, Oberst should undoubtedly be consulted for the soundtrack.<br /><br />\\""Freedom\\"" has its finger on the pulse of human discontent, particularly the kind Americans experience daily.  It is written so intelligently and with so much attention to detail and back-story that the 500+ pages that may put you off at first are essential to painting a fuller picture.  With a similar narrative style to that of John Irving, Franzen does not skip details or rush to the results in order to deliver a juicier but shallower tale.  He burrows deeply down into the center of the modern family, carving off details from the sides as he goes, and then splits it straight down the middle for us all to see its vulnerable and rotted core.<br /><br />Franzen builds his characters up over time so that you can understand better why your middle-aged neighbor remains miserably married and has not yet left his wife.  Or why that ambitious young woman that you knew in college married the \\""nice guy\\"" and yet remains despondent and unfulfilled in her later years when she seems to \\""have it all\\"".  Or, better still, why the children of this union seem to be carbon copies of their parents, only with less morals and more sense.  Franzen has a keen understanding of suburbia and through his eyes we can come to better understand our own.<br /><br />\\""Freedom\\"" shows us the perils of entrapment, how two people can't imagine life without each other when they deliberately make each other miserable.  It is impossible to vote for the \\""good guy\\"" here when everyone is so thoroughly damaged.  Yet they keep on, they fight for what they need and they don't give up when it appears that they have nothing left.<br /><br />I was expecting one character in particular to commit suicide and was thoroughly pleased when this did not happen.  That's the message of \\""Freedom\\"".  You may not get a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end of the novel, depending on your perspective, but that's okay because there are no warm and fuzzy endings in life.  There's just the determination and courage to persevere, and the maturity that allows us to separate what we want from what we need.  It's never too late to change.  After a lifetime of misery, there is still a shot at liberty.  We have the power to choose our own paths.  We often create our own prisons, inadvertently or otherwise, but we can always make the consciousdecision to escape.<br /><br />After all, would we truly appreciate the freedom we've earned if we were not first oppressed?y appreciate the freedom we've earned if we were not first oppressed?"

796,1616950544,3,"I read both Quentin Bates' Gunnhilder Mysteries prior to spending a few days in Iceland with the expressed intent of getting a feel for a country roughly the size of England but with a population of only 300,000.  This novel was disappointing as a mystery and as a description of the country and its inhabitants.  Bates' resolution of who murdered the promiscuous young lady is anti-climactic and without prior clues, i.e., the author simply declares the criminal.  There are some nice touches and I like his Gunna character - but she could be a female detective in any country.<br />As to Iceland - the reader is provided with little insight into a rugged, largely desolate country where everybody apparently can trace their ancestry back to the first settlers.  There is much fertile territory here: it is a pity Mr. Bates left the ground untilled."
797,0557631548,5,"I picked up this book for consideration in a new curriculum I was designing for the local community college.  I don't think this book would serve as the primary book for college students to learn programming but it would serve as a solid supplemental book (there is a cheaper paperback version). I would not be surprised if students skipped the primary book and concentrated all their efforts on this book since it covers a topic near and dear to many students majoring in computer science today - how to build games.  The chapters cover and supplement development of basic computer programming skills:<br /><br />Chapter 1 - Introduction to Programming<br />Chapter 3 - Variables and Methods<br />Chapter 4 - Operators<br />Chapter 5 - Conditionals<br />Chapter 7 - Loops<br />Chapter 9 - Collection<br />Chapter 13  - Classes<br />Chapter 14 - Inheritance<br /><br />I can only recommend as a supplemental book since many key topics (e.g. objects) are not covered early or deeply enough for the average college student.  But, what it does present and cover is well done.  The examples are clear and I do believe the programs are such that students will be enhancing and showing off (unlike an example in a typical academic tome) to each other.  The author's approach is very appealing to the typical student who has grown up with video games and the Internet.<br />The other chapters enhance and use the programming concepts by having the students build actual games or game and gui elements:<br /><br />Chapter 2 - Drawing Shapes and Text<br />Chapter 6 - Key and Mouse Events<br />Chapter 8 - Threads and Timer<br /> This topic may seem pretty advance in a beginner programming course but it is quite natural in discussion of designing a game.<br />Chapter 10 - Swing Components<br />Chapter 11 - GUI Design<br />Chapter 12 - Events on Components<br />Chapter 15 - Internet Applications<br /><br />The book is easy to read and the examples easy enough to get up and running.<br /><br />Some folks(at least I did) may wonder about the relevance of teaching about Java Applets since they seem to be so passé. But, I think the benefits of being able to upload online some of the best programs  and prepare students for Android or mobile programming outweigh any thoughts about this not being the right technology. The concepts being presented apply to other platforms and languages - and who can argue with students having fun!"

I recently read Margaret Powell's \\""Below Stairs\\"" before I came across \\""Lady Almina\\"" in audio book at my local library. I seized the chance to listen to it as well. The book is quite concise, it is only 7 discs long, and nicely narrated.<br />The account of Lady Almina's life was quite fascinating, but interrupted as the story pretty much ended at the time of her husband's death. I would have liked to know what happened to her afterwards.<br />Still, the grand lifestyle, the adventures in Egypt, and the exploration \\""below stairs\\"" (and certainly, the circumstances of the servants on the estate were a far cry from the life experienced by Margaret Powell), were really interesting, as was the whole section dedicated to nursing during WWI.

805,034553087X,3,"The MB Series is one of my favorites. Yet, this book fell short. Up until now, I still haven't finished reading (skimmed through). Every time I pick it back up, I'm reminded of why I should stop.<br /><br />Personally, I felt some of the concepts introduced were either not necessary, or should have been introduced in increments. When you have set the rules from the beginning, you do NOT break them in a few sentences (female GenOnes? Why?). And yet, the major bombshells seemed glossed over.<br /><br />Dragos' death was another thing that bothered me. After the detailed way Marek's death was described, I thought this was a joke (perhaps he's not really dead...) If you hadn't been paying attention, you would have missed the fact that he got killed. For the most corrupt of Breed, he didn't put up much of a fight. Wilhelm Roth had a much more interesting death.<br /><br />I understand she had to wrap it up to introduce Mira and the future, but I felt somethings could have been better if she had broken them down and not forced them all into one book.<br /><br />Am I still a Lara fan?

Her job as assistant manager at a bakery was barely sustaining her financial leads, holding down her creativity, and to make matters worse her love life has gone down the drain. The move to Savannah, Georgia included a whole new life plan. A bakery that Aunt Lucy and Uncle Ben are opening, the Honeybee Bakery (named for her Aunt Lucy's cat) promises to provide that creative outlet she craves as well as financial stability; if, that is, all goes as planned.<br /><br />This is a hugely entertaining debut that promises a wonderful new series. It is a cozy mystery, that's for sure, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed every page.

810,0062088513,2,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand it has some of the traits of a classic. The character development with Alexandre the main character is amazing and the vivid detail between the the rich and poor is one that other novels have explored with great success.<br /><br />However, no real substantive theme developed along the way. Alexandre doesn't come to any real inner turmoil until near the end of the book and even then he comes to embrace a reality that is inevitable. The book ends up being a long build up with a minimal climax.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.  The book is filled with conflict on the periphery, but contains very little of the stuff that makes a book a good read. This may have been intentional and fit what I think the author was going for but then lacked the actual punch of conflict at the end as a sharp contrast to the measured calm through out the book. If the author would have spent as much time fleshing out the details of conflict at the end as he did detailing the mundane life of a valet at the beginning of the book, then the novel would have been exceptional. As it is, it's a let down."

815,1904738923,3,"Harri Nyk&auml;nen's \\""Nights of Awe,\\"" translated from the Finnish by Kristian London, takes place during the holiest time of the Jewish year--a period of repentance that culminates in the Day of Atonement. At a time when his fellow Jews are contemplating their past deeds and preparing for the holiday, our narrator, forty-year old bachelor Ariel Isaac Kafka, is busier than ever with his job as a detective in Helsinki's Violent Crime Unit.  Chief Detective Huovinen summons Kafka to Linnunlaulu, where two dead bodies (\\""the deceased are most likely foreigners\\"") have been found.  Along with Detective Mika Simolin and the rest of his team, Ariel will be up to his ears in corpses before the matter is laid to rest.<br /><br />What follows is an investigation so complicated that it is difficult to describe coherently.  Suffice it to say that the inquiry involves the Israeli Mossad, Iraqi-born nationals, SUPO (the Finnish Security Police), and an old buddy of Ariel's who may have gone rogue. When the dust settles and the truth emerges, Ariel is disheartened by the stupidity, self-destructiveness, greed, and heartlessness of his fellow human beings.<br /><br />Nyk&auml;nen does not focus on character as much as plot and the story is dense and confusing.  Multiple killings and acts of torture occur off-stage; we never get to know much about the victims.  At least the author provides Ariel with a bit of shading--he lost his father at a young age, his mother was overbearing, religion means little to him, and he is doggedly determined to bring criminals to justice.  So much is going on in this novel--drug dealing, terrorism, covert operations, and more--that the reader's head may begin to spin.  Nor does the rushed and far-fetched conclusion help matters.  On the other hand, the forensics and police procedures are handled professionally and add a bit of verisimilitude to the narrative.<br /><br />\\""Nights of Awe\\"" presents a cynical worldview in which people ruthlessly exploit one another.

With all fiction one has to suspend a little disbelief and this is no exception as a couple of reviewers have indicated. However, the book is a real page turner.

820,1595554599,5,"This was an enjoyable read as I unlearned a lot of poison attached to Jefferson.  Each chapter begins with various headlines that accuse Jefferson of this or that while afterwards Barton references numerous sources to debunk these stories.  It is sad these days that our media and education systems care so little about truth and integrity.<br /><br />The most interesting chapter is the one examining Jefferson's religious beliefs.  By his own admission Jefferson claimed to be a Christian, however he was no \\""orthodox\\"" Christian.  While he attended church services, was generous and friendly to many churches, he definitely did not believe in \\""Sola Scriptura\\"", the divine authority of the bible as God's word.

821,0375714367,4,"I usually read a book all the way through, sometimes in a few days, sometimes over a weekend. But this book was so engrossing, it was on my mind the entire time I was away from it. I wanted to dive back into it and immerse myself into the lives of the characters, into this warm cocoon of familial love in unfamiliar surroundings.<br /><br />There are many levels of challenge here - the foreign-ness (for most of us) of Ethiopia. The sterile, other worldliness of the operating room; the super sensitive connection of the twins; the religious background of their mother; the rigid rejection of their father and the overwhelming devotion of their adoptive parents. This book demands your focus but it is not a difficult read in spite of the many descriptions of surgery and operating room protocol.<br /><br />The way in which the author weaves medical expertise into the narrative is extraordinary and not only does not detract from the power of the story, but adds to it. I winced through every difficult operation but could not skim over any of them. It is a testament, I think, to the dedication of this doctor (the writer is a physician) to his profession.  He is deft in making these scenes crucial in revealing the characters whose personalities and histories are vividly portrayed and far from stereotypical.<br /><br />I congratulate Dr. Verghese for having the courage to deviate from the same old formulaic drivel that is filling up our libraries today.  This book defies categorization and dares to be different.  It is a fitting and admirable tribute, in every way, I think, to its author."

823,0061985120,5,"Dennis Prager has provided a tour de force for conservative thought. First of all, before reviewing the book that was written, it is important to debunk the reviews about the book that was not written. (For those want a review of the real book, please skip down 3 paragraphs.) The 1-star reviewer below \\""Shade\\"" clearly has not even purchased, let alone read, this book. This is easily proved by his question and statement: \\""why won't Prager tell you that the original intention of E Pluribus Unum was to indicate that out of many states (the original thirteen) one nation could be forged (with a central, federal government)? Instead he chooses to interpret this phrase from some singular conservative perspective, insisting that his is the only true and proper interpretation.\\"" But on page 373 Prager wrote, \\""At first the pluribus in E Pluribus Unum referred to the thirteen original colonies - and the motto was adopted in order to help forge these many colonies into unum, one nation.\\"" This is typical of those who attack Prager. They consistently attribute things to him he did not say or simply make something up, which anyone who actually listens to or reads him knows is untrue. But truth is obviously not as high a value as smearing a thoughtful conservative who changes minds and hearts every single day. \\""Shade\\"" has provided yet another example proving one of Prager's main theses in section 1 of his book - the Left would rather demonize the Right than tell the truth.<br /><br />One more example of Shade's distortion: \\""In Prager's simplistic reductio ad absurdum there are only three, that's right THREE, philosophies in all the world.\\"" Prager never even suggested these are the only three \\""philosophies in all the world.\\"" In fact, you only have to get to page 16, still in the introduction, to see in bold letters, \\""Is there a Fourth - the Chinese - Alternative?\\"" Prager then discusses their ideology as a model but dismisses it as a viable option for global hegemony. The reviewer shows his own simplistic reductio ad abdurdum by falsely assuming that viable hegemonic ideologies are the same as any ideology. Prager does not discuss anarchy, for example, since it is not a viable hegemonic ideology. Shade  also fails to provide another possible global alternative that does not fall under the three Prager deconstructs.<br /><br />Now for the 2-star review: \\""It's ironic how Prager routinely criticizes the left for its narcissism, and then he turns around and writes a book about how wonderful the U.S. empire is.\\"" At least this reviewer got half of it right - Prager does consistently point out how much better Leftists think they are than conservatives, morally, intellectually, etc. Prager wrote a 400 page book and spent only 80 on the American value system, let alone the US. The other 310 pages are not about the US, so arguing that he wrote a book about the US Empire is absurd and, as with the above, demonstrates that the reviewer did not read the book and is more interested in smearing a thoughtful conservative than in truth. One more: \\""Prager is often critical of the government, but doesn't take on that aspect of big government that causes so much suffering around the world, the military industrial complex.\\"" Prager discusses this on pages 49-51. He also discusses and debunks the Chris Hedges work (pointing out that those like him) castigates intolerance, but seems entirely unaware of the intolerance of his own rhetoric and positions regarding Christians in the US (see page 131). Finally, he discusses the role of the US military in that very context on pages 382-387. Here he argues that the US has been - despite it's moral blemishes which he discusses on pages 380-383 - the least oppressive, least authoritarian, and most benign world superpower in human history and has liberated, among others, the Japanese, Chinese, Germans, South Koreans, Kuwaitis, and Iraqis, respectively. The fact that Japan, Germany, and South Korea have been able to turn into suchwonderful societies while US troops have continued to \\""occupy\\"" suggests how different the US \\""Empire\\"" has been from every single other global power in recorded history. The US also leads the world in charitable giving and is the first place people all over the world look to when natural disasters or human-inflicted evils happen. Just as those in Haiti regarding the former and Kuwait regarding the latter. A final example to prove the reviewer never read the book nor likely listened to his show: \\""Most people who like Prager's views aren't interested in exploring alternative views.\\"" The whole point of the book is to explore alternative views and his shortest section is on the one he advocates.<br /><br />The book Prager did write is about the three most viable ideological systems in the world today - what he calls Leftism, Islamism, and Americanism. He provides a wonderful appendix at the end of the book listing the American and Leftist positions to major issues such as \\""the state,\\"" \\""primary source of evil,\\"" \\""family ideal,\\"" \\""individual's income,\\"" \\""place of religion in America,\\"" etc. Prager's thesis is that the best hope for a better world is embodied in the American value system, which is synonymous with conservatism.<br /><br />Prager devotes over half of the book to Leftism, precisely defining it, articulating what the ideology contains, why it is attractive to hundreds of millions of people, and its moral record during the 20th century. Leftism for Prager is embodied in the social democratic parties of Western Europe and the Democratic Party in the US. Ultimately he concludes that Leftism and all of its satellite ideologies - feminism, environmentalism, secularism, moral relativism, etc. - morally and economically bankrupt those who adhere to it. Prager contends that although its advocates use moral rhetoric and are well-intentioned, the policies they espouse produce selfishness, apathy, and, as seen in Western Europe's birth-rate, a staggering ennui. To support his case he looks not only to the obvious failures of 20th century far Left in the former Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Laos, and North Korea, but the seemingly successful cases like France, Germany, and Spain. Though he admits these are decent countries that have relatively more liberty than most of the rest of the world, their preoccupation with economic equality and state-sponsored benefits has economically and morally bankrupted an entire continent. He claims that most people in these countries do not recognize true evil - communism, Islamism, Terrorism - and instead choose to fight lesser or quasi-evils like climate change, second hand smoke, or onomastic notions of \\""intolerance.\\"" Prager also shows how ideas from the Left pervade our most influential institutions - the university, primary and secondary schools, many churches and other religious institutions, Hollywood, and almost all media outlets - talk radio and Fox News excluded. His deconstruction of the language that the media uses in presenting what otherwise seems like \\""just the news\\"" is particularly revealing. For example, he shows how AP reports frequently choose to use terms like \\""sectarian violence\\"" to describe Islamic terror while carefully avoiding the terms \\""Muslim, Islamic,\\"" etc. - be it violence against Christians, Jews, or fellow Muslims. They do this, Prager notes, while carefully not ascribing Islamic influences to terrorism committed by those like Nidal Hassan who screamed \\""Allahu Akbar,\\"" before shooting 13 innocents, was a card-carrying member of \\""Soldier of Allah,\\"" and raised repeated red flags about his Islamist sympathies. Finally, Prager contends that Leftism's preoccupation with having others (the state) provide for even the able-bodied citizen has, and will continue to, wear away at the fabrics of what was once a dynamic European culture. In short, they have produced a culture that stresses individual benefits but collective (and therefore no meaningful) responsibility.<br /><br />Next Prager analyzes Islamism, which he defines as a political form of violent Islam that is embodied in Hamas, Hezbollah, and Al Qaeda. He never seriously considers the US as possibly moving toward Islamism, but does implicitly suggest that it poses a real threat to the African continent, the Middle-East where it already dominates in many areas, and even Southern and Western Europe. He indirectly suggests that the latter could fall victim to Islamism due to their Leftist commitment to multiculturalism, inability to recognize true evil and assimilate foreigners, and their quasi-pacifism. Prager, a scholar at the Middle-East Institute at the Columbia University School of International Affairs, is critical of Islamism, but takes pains to distinguish it from other forms of peaceful Islam that are practiced peacefully throughout the world. That said, he is also careful to note that the number of peaceful adherents to Islam is irrelevant to the threat of Islamism. He cites the relatively few Nazi supporters there were in Germany in 1932 or committed communists in the Soviet Union or China as evidence to suggest that it is not the presence of a peaceful majority that matters, but the hegemonic influence of the threatening minority and the way the majority responds to that threat, that are important. For example, only 7-10% of the Islamic world supports Islamism, but that minority is still no less a threat. Finally, Prager holds out hope for the Muslim world by concluding that Islam - though it is in a low moral, intellectual, social, and economic state today, with its honor killings, intolerance of other religions, and obsession with de-legitimizing and destroying Israel - can have a bright future. He compares the medieval Christian world, which had many of the same characteristics - religious bigotry, little emphasis on liberty, etc. - to show how reformation is possible. He insists that the only way that it is possible, however, is if the Left, through organizations like CAIR,stop stymieing all criticism toward Islam and Muslims themselves unite in large numbers to condemn violence in their name. Here, as with the world in general, he believes that American Muslims hold out the best hope for Muslims elsewhere.<br /><br />Prager's last section, though brief, is on Americanism. Here he articulates, better than any writer I know of, the case for conservatism and American values. He insists that American values are, as inscribed on our coinage, E Pluribus Unum, In God We Trust, and, most important, Liberty. Prager contrasts these values with the Leftist values of Multiculturalism, Secularism, and Equality. Though not all Leftists disdain liberty and not all Rightists disdain equality, he carefully demonstrates where each differs. He outlines 11 total American values in addition to these three pillars, showing how reason, for example, is critically important in any culture, but is insufficient by itself. He also argues for the sanctity of human life, the distinction between animals and humans, the difference between nature and, as Jefferson would put it, Natures God, and the limits of using material wealth as the supreme value the way the Left does. Prager insists that these values are not specific to America and can be adopted by any country, using Uruguay and as an example. He draws an important distinction here - other nations may retain their own cultures while simultaneously adopting these values. Finally, Prager tackles the typical charges that Islamists and those on the Left make against America. Claims of \\""American Imperialism\\"" are presented in context with comparable global powers to demonstrate how benign (despite sometimes overstepping bounds) the US has been over the last 100 years. He also presents a particularly compelling case for why America - even if one believes it is not a net force for good in the world - is better than any non-utopian alternative; namely, China, Russia, Iran, Turkey, Western Europe, and the UN.<br /><br />Though Dennis Prager has few moderate ideological positions (he is as ideologically pure a conservative as exists), his presentation is as calm, fair, and clear as anyone writing today of any persuasion. All Americans should read this book. Even if one detests the Right, this is as lucid an explanation of conservative thought as exists. We owe it to ourselves to read the best of those with whom we differ. This book qualifies as the best. Thoughtful moderates and liberals - though few Leftists - will find the text to be well-reasoned and the conclusions insightful, even if they disagree on certain matters. For others, it will change the way they view the world. The book is almost 400 pages, contains 350 endnotes, and at least another 100 in-text references."

825,0373754086,5,"Cooper Drummond fled the family Triple D Ranch and his girlfriend Willow Courtland to join the rodeo.  Willow married Tate Walker on the rebound.  Tate proved a nasty husband who refused to accept their autistic daughter Lily as his.  When he died in a brawl, she inherited their rundown ranch.<br /><br />Retired from the rodeo so his bones could heal, Coop rejects his older brother Sullivan's demands to either come home or sign his share of the spread to his nephew.  He learns of a widow needing help so he travels to the spread to obtain work.  To his shock, the widow is Willow.  Coop wants a second chance, but Willow refuses as she cannot afford a broken heart when Lily needs her.  However, Coops' patience and nurturing of Lilybelle begins to win over the love of his life.<br /><br />The key to this strong second chance at love ranch romance is Lilybelle whose disorder brings together the lead couple.  Character driven, Rox Denny Fox provides a wonderful tale of a couple still in love as they were in their Aggie days but distrusting one another.  As a mother of a high functioning Asperger's Syndrome, I am biased when it comes to the special needs of those on the Autism Spectrum; as Ms. Fox captures the essence of the relationship between a caring parent and a low to middle functioning child.  The Maverick Returns is terrific as love heals many psychological wounds.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner"

829,0062060619,3,"The Song of Achilles is a retelling of the life of Achilles through the eyes of his friend and lover, Patroclus.  The style of writing was fine, not great.  The story was similar to the classic version in only the most major points.  Achilles' character development was in reverse...he went from more sensitive and considerate to more blood-thirsty and less compassionate.  Patroclus narrated the story throughout, even when he was in the \\""spirit-world,\\"" which made the last few chapters a little odd.  The action sequences were lacking in tension.  The \\""sex\\"" scenes were not particularly graphic.  The characterization of Thetis, Achilles' mother, was consistently cold.  The relationship between Achilles and Patroclus seemed much more angst-filled than would have been reasonable in a society where bisexuality was not overly stigmatized.  If homosexual relationships are offensive to you, you will NOT enjoy this book.  Otherwise, it was an OK read of how Achilles got to the Trojan War and performed once he arrived."

831,1932603794,1,"Like many people new to gluten-free, I bought several books on the subject, and found this to be by far the most disappointing. I understand why it appeals to so many people; you can call yourself gluten-free with the least number of changes to your lifestyle.<br /><br />The problem is that this book does address gluten-free issues; but not how to really be healthy. It only addresses part of the problem, by substituting high glycemic index foods, like rice starch and potato starch for gluten. It solves one problem, but adds to another. You can live gluten-free like this, but still be overweight, and develop diabetes. \\""Dietician-approved\\"" or not, it's just not good advice at all; when will registered dieticians learn?  Developing diabetes and heart problems is not my idea of \\""hassle free.\\"" I don't like sounding so negative, but one look at the author's photograph on the back cover will confirm my point.<br /><br />I'm sorry I bought this book, and even sorrier that I took too long to look it over, so that it's not worth returning it to Amazon. A much better book, with real science and good advice, is Davis's book, [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]] It doesn't make the dietary change sound as easy and fun-filled as Brown's book; but it's far more healthy and realistic.

832,0756407427,5,"First Impressions: When Silence arrived for me to review, it made its way to the very top of my To-Read pile. I had been looking forward to this one ever since I feel in love with its gorgeous cover and its promise of a unique plot line. I haven't read too many books that contain necromancy and I was interested to see Michelle Sagara's take on that subject. Just from reading the synopsis, it also sounded like there would be a good contemporary story weaved in with the paranormal, which to me is a plus.<br /><br />First 50 Pages: I've always enjoyed Michelle Sagara's style of writing and Silence is just a good, if not better than her other books. Silence was a fast-paced book with a unique and interesting, darker then most plot line, a vast amount of characters, imaginative word play, and plenty of suspense that kept me entertained and on the edge of my seat. I loved how Michelle included an animal, Emma's Rottweiler, which I thought was charming and super cute since he even became of character of sorts! I basically flew through the first 50 pages of Silence and I felt invested into the story. It's nice when an author makes their book easy for you to read and enjoy. I honestly can't say that I found anything majorly wrong with this novel, and that is pretty rare for me.<br /><br />Characters & Plot: If anything is wrong, it might just be that I think the book blurb reveals too much of the plot. When I was writing down notes while reading Silence, my book synopsis mirrors the book blurb. It gives away far too much information for my taste, so instead of spitting out the same synopsis you can find above, I'm going to focus on the characters with all of their awesomeness.<br /><br />All of the characters in Silence were very likeable and had personality, even the minor characters. I was so glad that this book had a great female protagonist, Emma. She is a super strong and determined character that had been through some tough times in her life. She had to deal with the death of her boyfriend, and the author really makes you feel for her character. Even though Emma has had to deal with a ton of heartbreak, she is always willing to do for others and consistently puts the people that she cares about before herself. Emma is only of my favorite characters I have come across so far this year.<br /><br />I've been feeling burnt out when it comes to stories that include love triangles because they are so overused now, which drives me crazy. It was so nice to read a book that finally didn't have a love triangle. I thought there was one at first, but throughout the story it was clear that Emma only had one suitor. Even though there was no love triangle, there are still two guys who are around Emma quite a bit. Eric and Chase were very interesting characters because they began the story with the intent to kill Emma for their own reasons, but that doesn't really work out after they get to know Emma and find out more about her special abilities and how she intends on using them. It was definitely a different approach and it made the book way more entertaining than it would have been otherwise.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: I am so excited for the next book in the series to come out! Michelle Sagara has impressed me yet again with another fantastic story. I loved how realistic and emotional Silence was and how the author handled some of the tough topics that were included and pivotal to the plot. I would recommend checking around your local bookstore for this one when it is released. I think fans of the paranormal, fans of Michelle Sagara, and people who enjoy rich characters with a unique plot line will definitely fall in love with Silence!eath of her boyfriend, and the author really makes you feel for her character.

833,1416972250,5,"I know you are probably sick by now of reading my Mortal Instruments reviews, but I can't stop rereading these lovely books! I'll try to keep this as short and sweet as possible... here goes...<br /><br />In this third installment of The Mortal Instruments series, us readers find ourselves amid some very high tensions between our characters. Clary and Jace, Jace and Simon, Simon and Clary, Valentine and the world... really things are not going well for this race of Shadowhunters. As the gang from the New York Institute prepare to head to Idris for negotiations and to give explainations of what's been happening with Valentine, they are attacked by Forsaken as they enter the portal. This attack leads to a turn of events that leads all of our favorite characters on a journey in which they will fight for their lives!<br /><br />This book will make you laugh like always, but it will also make you cry. Cassandra Clare spares no one in the war against Valentine and as her story meanders through Idris, the fabeled home country of the Shadowhunters, we find ourselves mourning the loss of loved ones right along with her characters. Clare is such an emotional writer and I've come to love her subtle style of wrenching her readers hearts out.<br /><br />The Mortal Instruments series was originally meant to be a trilogy, but that plan back fired as Clare's 5th installment is set to release this month... and I'm not complaining! Because this was supposed to be the finale to the series, there are a lot of loose ends that are tied up and the book ends on an almost happy note, which is somewhat uncharacteristic of this series. I was almost disappointed that Clare didn't treat us to a tragic, cliff hanger ending... but don't worry, I've read book 4 and we are in for the some big surprises!<br /><br />Overall, I really loved this book. I want to say better than the previous two, but this one is so different from the other two in the series. Finally, we have Clary coming into contact with the place her mother grew up, the origin of the Shadowhunters and she finally sees herself as one of them. It was so great getting a chance to see Idris and this change in setting really does make this story stand apart from City of Bones and City of Ashes.<br /><br />That's all I've got for this one guys!

I get that BUD/S trainees get abused both verbally and physically, yet I guess I never thought it went to this level.

The story lived up to the cover, with written illustrations of the settings that I found enchanting. The Alabama town is portrayed as picturesque, and the citizens are full of southern charm. The characters are a close-knit bunch, and Lizzie goes out of her way to make newcomers, like Sally-Jo Baker, feel welcome. With a laundry list of clues, a handful of suspects, and a few plausible scenarios for the murder, Lizzie and the police have their work cut out for them.<br /><br />I read A Killer Read in just two sittings.

838,0062103970,3,"This is the story of Mick Little, whose life deteriorates after the death of his wife. Although he has two sons, he is not close emotionally or physically to either of them. His descent into poverty and homelessness is one of great tragedy and Raisin's telling of this tale is powerful and emotional and quite significant in the troubled times."
839,0813134161,5,"Among an endless number of books on WW2, this book is, in my opinion, the first one which demonstrates clearly its thesis which is: that the extermination war in the East could not have happened without the full collaboration of the German army. To quote Fritz's words: \\""The army leadership raised no objections to the flood of criminal orders emanating from the Fuhrer and the OKW. Indeed, during the summer and autumn of 1941,army leaders often explicitly urged their troops, in ideologically charged anti-Semitic proclamations, to wage war on National Socialistic lines and discard notions of humane treatment of the enemy\\"".<br />In short, no such murderous actions were possible without the army's full involvememnt. The Wermacht was not alone in this war of extermination. Its commanders were assisted by the murderous Einsatzgruppen units as they carried out their bloody task, offering logistic, intelligence and communications support,as well as occasionally furnishing manpower for executions. Army security units used ruthless methods to suppress the partisan war as well as embracing the use of SS and police units in order to pacify and safeguard rear areas. It remorselessly plundered and stripped the areas under its control of foodstuffs and order to feed itself off the land, regardless of the consequences for local civilians. The Wermacht's complicity and its commanders in Hitler's crimes is clearly presented to the reader, who will have to face a catalogue of extreme and horrible crimes during this long and spellbinding book.<br />Professor Fritz asks , on many occasions, why the the Wermacht has agreed to be an accomplice of Hitler's madness, and he comes up with a simple answer: the Wermacht was ideologically infused with the belief that the Eastern peoples, especially the minorities and the Jews, had to be exterminated, since they were the scum of the earth, according to the Fuhrer.<br />This book is not only a synthesis of well-established facts, but it also offersthe reader an excellent analysis of the various main battles during the war. Eight out of ten German soldiers died  in the east, while more than four million soldiers died there between 1941-1945, compared to more than ten million Russian soldiers who perished there.<br />If you plan to read one comprehensive book on this topic, then this is the book for you. It is extremely well researched and its language is vivid and easy to read, although the fact that you will have to tackle many details. Professor's Fritz's forte is in his ability to tell the story of the bestial deeds of the Wermacht in a very simple yet rich language. This book should be a part of everybody's library in order to remind you to what extent the human  psyche can sometimes reach the abyss."

A beautiful story about the somewhat precariously constructed friendships borne out of a shared love of music.

845,0743536134,3,"I knew going from English to Korean was going to be harder than any of the european languages I've tried from Pimsleur; but I wasn't ready for the rapid native speakers. Korean sentences aren't structured at all like English. And,the Korean native speakers they use speak so fast that you often cannot tell 'm's from 'n's, etc., and the words all mix into each other so you can't tell which is which, then when the ends of the words change with context, you're really going to feel lost. Still, it worked, in a manner of well, speaking. I learned enough to understand and communicate. Remember though, if you don't use the language, you will forget it. After you complete the course, every month, do at least one lesson in each language you learn; it's easiest to just take them in your car and speak as you drive. BTW; my original reason for learning Korean was to understand the Korean entertainment available on the net. There's plenty of great movies, tv shows, and terrific music. Just remember, the lyrics are even harder to understand than regular speech, so understanding songs will be even harder than tv shows."

847,B000WFZJUE,4,"Point: Separation is a crucial element in the life of every believer.<br /><br />Path:  Written from a pastor to pastors, the author seeks to give the biblical reasons for separation. He lays them out in thirteen different axioms seeking to give scriptural support for each.<br /><br />Agreement: I thought that the author's list of established and self-evident truths was helpful. Some of them were things which I had not thought about before, others I had. The first few I have come to see and understand: Scripture forbids us to have fellowship with unbelief, commands us to reprove apostasy, teaches us that we must purge unbelief, teaches us that a believer and unbeliever cannot be yoked together in spiritual endeavors, and teaches us to separate from disobedient brethren (pg. 29).<br /><br />Questions: Ashbrook notes that the Bible teaches that we cannot fellowship with those who do not practice separation. How far do we go? Second degree separation? Third or fourth? There is a struggle here and I do not have all the answers.<br /><br />Personal App: I believe that there are certain things over which we should separate and other we should not. I don't think that we ought to separate from another church over their choice of music, usage of a variety of Bible versions, service schedule, or color of choir robes. The common belief among certain groups is that \\""if we don't believe exactly the same, we cannot fellowship.\\""<br /><br />Favorite Quote: \\""Separation is not the answer to every disagreement between brethren\\"" (pg. 29).<br /><br />It would be worth another read and I would recommend it. It received 4 stars instead of 5 because although it was helpful it was not life changing."
848,0425204308,4,"This is the 16th novel in the 'Prey' series which features Lucas Davenport.  The series began with 'Rules of Prey' with renegade cop Lucas tracked down a serial killer that was terrorizing Minneapolis.  As the series has progressed we have seen Davenport undergo many changes, including becoming wealthy (from designing computer games), and giving up his wild, womanizing ways to settle down into domestic bliss with a wife and children.  For the next few weeks though Lucas is once again on his own, his wife, Weather, is working in London for the summer and has taken the children and their live in nanny along.  Davenport finds that he has more than enough to keep him busy when a woman's body is found, one who had died a violent death at the hands of a sadistic killer.  The trail of this murderer leads Davenport and many of his usual co-horts on a twisted chase before they once again manage to ferret out the truth.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier the main character of this series, Lucas Davenport, has changed drastically over the course of this series.  In the beginning of the series he was a cold, ruthless character, one who thought nothing about using any woman who crossed his path.  Now he is being presented as a devoted family man who is missing his wife and children.  The change has taken place gradually over the course of the series but it is still difficult to reconcile the two extremes as being the same character.  As other reviewers have mentioned this particular entry into the series seems to drag a bit, it would, at least in my opinion, be a better story if it had been edited down a bit - perhaps 50 to a 100 pages.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent series, it is exciting and generally well written although it is quite violent and many scenes are very graphic,  so it is not a series that I would recommend to a teen nor to a senior.  The series is does occur in chronological order, later stories do refer to previous events so do read the stories in order as much as possible."

The book is simple, easy read, and focuses entirely on entertainment.  Kirk Scroggs is the best in the buisness when it comes to writing short, comedic graphic novels for kids.

Both are accomplished academics who have studied childhood literacy front to back, bottom to top, and inside to outside. They can recite theory and papers and pedagogy all day long with the best of them. But what they instill in this book and other venues is enthusiasm about reading. If it's boring and irrelevant, the kiddos are gonna pick up on that and lose interest. Make it interesting and relevant, make it fun, make it exciting, and you're pretty much ahead of everyone else. Clyde and Condon show you some practical ways to do this."
855,0136054846,5,"This is a textbook by genre only.  It is in reality a marvelous introduction to Renaissance Italy, as suitable for the general reader as for the captive readership in a college class.  It is learned, well-balanced, thorough, and highly readable.<br /><br />Let me list just a few of its many virtues - those that most appealed to me.<br /><br />1) It integrates history and culture.  Unlike most history books that discuss culture (i.e., such aspects of life as art, literature, family life, government and politics) as discreet subjects having little or nothing to do with the traditional chronological history of events, Dr. Kaborycha integrates these subjects into her chronological narrative.  Thus, Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and dozens of other artistic and literary \\""greats\\"" that for most people define the very essence of \\""the Renaissance\\"" are presented not in some kind of artistic \\""bubble\\"" or time warp, but as real people producing their masterworks in a real historical context, not only dependent on the favor and patronage of men of great power and wealth such as Cosimo and Lorenzo de' Medici, but responsive to a specific cultural and political context that helps us to understand why they did the kind of art they did.  Equally valuable are discussions of broader cultural elements: e.g., the rise of literacy and learning, the development of \\""vernacular\\"" culture (i.e., literacy in Italian rather than Latin) and the importance of rhetoric for the political culture.<br />2) It contains marvelously helpful little footnotes that explain terms that are often taken for granted in most books.  For instance, on page 54 we are informed that \\""fresco\\"" painting comes from the Italian word for \\""fresh\\"" and refers to the technique of painting directly onto fresh plaster walls.  On page 62, we are told in a few words not only what a papal \\""bull\\"" is, but why it is called a \\""bull.\\""  I was familiar with most of these terms, but I was oftennot aware of where they came from.<br />3) The author relates the origin and development of all the major cities and states of Italy.  We are told not just that there were communes, but where the communes came from, how they developed out of medieval communities.  I was particularly struck by the discussion of how Venice, a city built on a few scattered islands, came to be a widely feared and respected power - something I knew almost nothing about.  Even the southern regions (Naples and Sicily) are not neglected.  Note also that in addition to bibliographies for further reading at the end of each chapter, there is also a list useful internet resources.<br /><br />The one major drawback of the book, which has already been mentioned in another review, was a calculated one on the part of the author (read: publisher).  There are very few pictures (though there are quite a few useful maps).  This, the author tells us, was due strictly to matters of cost.  And in fact it is not such a great hardship in this day and age when virtually all the great works of art are readily available on the internet.  And in fact a marvelous collection of slides is available for each chapter in the book on the author's own website.  Just have your laptop/tablet at your side while reading the book, and you'll never miss the pictures.<br /><br />I will not take the time to detail every virtue of this book.  Suffice it to say that there are many more than I have described.  This book really is the epitome of what an introductory history text should be, unlike those pallid, tasteless, insipid \\""textbooks\\"" that have been inflicted on students since time immemorial.  Hopefully many others will sit up and take note and use this as a model for future textbooks."

However I do keep reading them so that has to count for something.  With this last book though I really feel like the author is just stringing us along to keep making coin on a series that barely had enough wind in its sails to make it to book three.  I have no problem with a long series if it has a point but how many times does the author have to put the Talbots into the same exact siege situation only to have them miraculously escape???  I will buy book 5 but thats my limit and yes I know the author is dragging the story out even further for a 6th book!!  Read Mountain man instead for a great and realistic zombie story."

The program has gone through many evolutions and has become the must-have for serious digital artists.<br /><br />With all the new features added over the years, I felt I needed a refresher on the new selection techniques. And those have improved greatly in version 5.5.<br /><br />What I learned from the first two chapters alone blew me away and was worth the price of admission. If you need to select people from their complex backgrounds and retain the detail of the hair, this book will show you how to do it effortlessly with the new selection tools and options, as well as selection- and adjustment masks.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for advanced users who want to get the most out of Photoshop."

All I can say is Spielberg did a hell of a job if this is what he had to work with. The book has NONE of the magic from the film. I was hard-pressed to find anyone to like in the story and found myself rooting for the shark to hurry up and eat EVERYONE. There was nothing likable about anyone, no clever back and forth oneupmanship between Quint and Hooper, no Quint charm with his off-color songs or catch phrases, no real suspense or climax, ridiculous plot tangents involving love stories and organized crime. Pages and pages of filler that had nothing to do with anything. This is a glowing example of the exception that proves the rule that the book is always better than the movie. Skip this and pop the movie in again instead."

872,0615606075,4,"(This review has been edited for content...)<br /><br />I liken the experience of reading Shane McKenzie's debut novella INFINITY HOUSE to what I suppose Lassie's little buddy, Timmy, experienced falling down that well. You think you know what you're doing going in, not worried about the consequences of fooling around near an old, abandoned well. I'm (flipping) Timmy, after all, I'm a blond-haired, blue-eyed little (weenie) with an awesome dog, what the (heck) could happen to me? You think I'm going to let some (crappy), forgotten well scare me? (Darn) that and (darn) you.<br /><br />And then you're falling, tumbling, down into the dark, faster than you even realize, all manner of horrific ideas running through your mind, including such thoughts as, oh (darn), I'm falling down this well, which is likely filled with monsters and evil and snakes and bones and spiders and raccoon urine and clowns. And then you hit the bottom.<br /><br />That's this book. It's got the monsters and the evil, but instead of spiders, you have flies, and instead snakes, it's maggots. A sea of maggots up to your chest, and rotting meat, disgusting stench, liquefied nastiness. INFINITY HOUSE is the story of Mike and his little brother James. They live in The Oak, a ghetto where Mike sells weed out the front door to pay the bills. His grandmamma is infirm and his mother is dead and only Mike is left to care for James.<br /><br />Mike is ripped off by a customer toting a shotgun and loses his stash and his cash, but little brother James comes home with money in hand. He found it over at the creepy haunted house that everyone in The Oak knows to steer clear of, but with no money and no more weed to sell to make some money, Mike and James head to the house to see what more they can find. OH (crap) MIKE DON'T GO IN THAT HAUNTED HOUSE YOU DUMB(rear end) IT'S HAUNTED BY A CHILD-KILLING FREAK! STOP SMOKING THE MARIJUANA IT'S DESTROYING YOUR SENSES!<br /><br />That's about all the setup you need, andall the setup you're going to get because by the time Mike and his little bro step inside the house, you're headed straight down that well. The story takes off like a roman candle at that point, piling on one slippery, slimy, disgusting, horrific scene after the next until you finally splash down at the bottom and try to catch your breath, or at least keep from ralphing in your lap. I won't lie, there are a few passages in here that got my stomach turning. I expected this book to be nasty, but it still managed to get to me.<br /><br />But that what's it's supposed to do. INFINITY HOUSE is straight up gross-out horror, and it doesn't even attempt to be anything more than that, which is cool. McKenzie, in an interview included in the back of the book, says as much. He's out to shock you, stun you, make you feel queasy, uncomfortable, lightheaded, sick, whatever he can get. If the idea of millions of squirming maggots and rotting, mushy meat squishing under your feet is too much for you, then you'll probably want to take a pass on this one. But if you dig that sort of thing, McKenzie is a name to watch out for.<br /><br />Personally, I don't go out of my way to seek out the extreme horror, but I don't reject it out of hand, either. I think it takes skill to write a story that's both compelling and also over-the-top nasty at the same time. That type of book can get tedious and just flat gross real fast. To his credit, McKenzie doesn't let it get to that point. He doesn't give us a lot of characterization when it comes to Mike or James, but he trades that in for a short little rocket ride of gore that will be over before you know it, if you can just hold out to the end. I'm intrigued and looking forward to what he comes up with next."
873,0375714367,5,"This is a book I picked up numerous times.  I read the back cover blurb and put it back on the shelf; I really didn't think it would interest me.  Well, how wrong I was.  This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I could kick myself for waiting so long to read it.  It is absolutely phenomenal, and my review can not possibly do it justice.<br /><br />It is the story of Marion and Shiva Stone, twin brothers born of a beautiful Indian nun and a brilliant British surgeon. Orphaned by their mother's death and their father's disappearance soon after their birth,  the twins grow up in Ethiopia, raised by two doctors who adore them.  Both of the twins become fascinated by medicine at an early age.  Due to what Marion saw as the ultimate betrayal by Shiva, the brother separate and go their own ways.<br /><br />I will not spoil the story by saying more, except that this is one of the best books I've ever read.  It was hard to put down.  The story was elegantly told, crafted with much care and beautiful writing."
874,1400064163,4,"With over 2300 posted reviews, I can't add much other than to say all Americans should read this book at some point in their lives.  My father is a WWII vet, serving in France and wounded there, so my perspective of the war really revolves around what was going on in Europe.  I didn't really have a very good understanding of the war going on in the Pacific.<br /><br />This book focuses on one man's life --- from juvenile delinquent and trouble-maker all the way through his Olympic career, military career and aftermath.  He lead an incredible life and the story of his years as a POW seem too horrific to be true, but they obviously are.<br /><br />A story of one man's unbelievable life, the story of all the military personnel serving in an important war, the sacrifices made by that generation, a story of putting your life back together when it's all over.<br /><br />Not an easy read but a very necessary one."
875,031261795X,3,"If there is one thing Neville Isdell wants you to know it is that he is six foot five.  Also that he is tall.  If I had an ice-cold Coke every time Isdell mentioned his height I would really have to burp.<br /><br />Apart from that the book is a light read but ultimately disappointing.  As someone who spent almost 15 years with Isdell's primary competitor, Pepsi-Cola International, and coincidentally spent a lot of time in the markets Isdell discusses, I know Coke to be a great company and a relentless competitor. I was hoping to gain some insights into the strategies and tactics Coke used to deal with different business challenges.  The book offers little in the way of specifics, though, preferring to nestle comfortably in the cushion of trite business blather, typified by this excerpt from Coca-Cola's so-called Manifesto, drafted by 150 Coke executives during a rough stretch of business:  \\""Bring to the world a portfolio of quality beverage brands that anticipate and satisfy people's desires and needs.\\""  Oh, so that's the trick!<br /><br />The subtitle gives it away: \\""A CEO's Life Story of Building the World's Most Popular Brand.\\""  Not surprisingly, then, Isdell focuses on his career path and the people he met along the way.  This is disappointing since Isdell led Coke during a time of tremendous change in the world - the fall of the Berlin Wall, the freeing of Nelson Mandela - as well as in the soft drink industry - the decline of returnable bottles, the rise of the \\""anchor bottler,\\"" the growth of juices, teas and waters.  These provided unprecedented challenges and opportunities.  Although Isdell does relate interesting and even poignant anecdotes, including meeting Mandela and retrieving a piece of the Berlin Wall, the book reads mostly like a travelogue of Isdell's assignments and the people he met and worked with.  The business message is mainly \\""work hard.\\""<br /><br />From my time at Pepsi I can report that the international soft drink business can be fun butis also challenging and even cut throat.  (To his credit, Isdell reports on Coke's numerous scrapes with legal and regulatory authorities.) There are three primary participants in the soft drink industry:  the franchise companies, the ones who actually own the brands, such as The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo; bottlers - franchisees who license the brands in order to manufacture and distribute the beverages; and \\""the trade,\\"" the retail establishments, ranging from first-world supermarket chains to convenience stores to fast food restaurants to the primitive \\""shebeens\\"" (pubs) in the townships of South Africa that Isdell mentions.<br /><br />\\""The secret,\\"" according to Isdell, \\""...is that everyone along the way, from start to finish, makes a profit.\\""  Completely accurate but not always so simple!  Just one weak link can damage the profits of the rest of the chain.  And there is an ongoing struggle amongst the participants for a bigger slice of the pie.<br /><br />I was hoping to learn how Coke balanced these interests in different situations.  What do they do in markets where they lead versus where they are behind?  What do they do in first-world versus third-world markets?  How do they decide on the mix of marketing spend on advertising versus distribution?<br /><br />Apart from a clear preference for consolidating Coke's bottler network, Isdell provides mainly generalities.  In Russia, Pepsi lost a 10 to 1 advantage over Coke because \\""they were sleeping.\\""  In the Middle East, however, Isdell \\""underestimated the strength of the Pepsi system.\\""  Well, what was the difference (apart from the fact that they were evidently 'awake')?  Isdell could certainly have spiced the book with more detailed case studies without giving away any trade secrets.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of the book is the final chapter on \\""Connected Capitalism.\\""  The phrase itself is a little too clever for me - he really means `capitalism.\\""  Quibbles aside, Isdell does a nice job capturing a sentiment I also felt while traveling overseas for Pepsi.  I was impressed, and so is Isdell, with the desire of ordinary people around the world to use their hard work, skills and creativity to better themselves.  He explains how people can be helped in a sustainable fashion only when profits exist which can be used to hire, train, expand and support relevant causes.<br /><br />Isdell makes the counterintuitive but correct point that a $25 million investment in a bottling plant in Afghanistan is a better use of the funds than had they been spent on a hospital:<br /><br />\\""Without jobs, without businesses, how would the hospital be able to sustain itself?...A thriving Coca-Cola bottling plant can help support that hospital through donations and through taxes paid by the company, its employees, and its vendors...Without capitalism the hospital would rely forever on handouts, an unsustainable model.\\""<br /><br />Well said and while Isdell may not have written a great business book he can be proud of the value he generated, the jobs he created and the consumers he satisfied during a long career with one of the world's great companies."

878,0983796300,4,"Sitting snug in my bed, I opened a window into the New York of the 60's/70's just by grabbing the book written by Paul LaRosa.<br />A journey into the intimacy of the author's memories who took me to a world of full of realism to describe the hippies period, the excesses in which the \\""peace and love\\"" youth reveled themselves but only known by its still powerful influence today for my generation.<br /><br />While pursuing my reading, my immersion in the writer's life took on the appearance of a history lesson, it also left me nostalgic for a time when I would have liked to sniff the atmosphere loaded with possibilities, adventure and celebrities.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of biographies. If I like a public figure or a star for its words, writings or talents although I never succumbed to hysteria of wanting to know every single details of its daily life.<br />However, reading the summary, I felt curiosity.<br /><br />At the mere mention of the temple of the night, sex and drugs, the famous Studio 54 and its scrolled celebrity or John Lennon's assassination, with details that only one journalist can so well described, I felt chills. To me, this time is real only through films, old clippings or old vinyl.<br />No live for me, just the recorded ...<br />Ditto for the AP or AFP dispatches, they have always been delivered via computer and my papers were never typed other than on a PC... It is this gap that touched and moved me. I was eager to know the juicy details of History when the author was reliving his story.<br /><br />I took this book as an amazing gift. Before starting it, I did not know the author. I really liked what he shared. His sincerity and courage that are necessary to let thousands of strangers glimpse into your memories, your faults, your hopes.

879,0615590535,5,"Growing up in Utah's Uintah Basin is a subject I've never before seen addressed in any book. This author's voice is so honest and candid that I didn't want to stop reading. Not a hint of self-pity anywhere, no (well-deserved) accusations, just a vibrant story full of well-drawn characters and compelling situations, from elementary school through early adulthood. I think this book will endure with any memoir on the shelf today. Glad I read it!"
880,1470070723,5,"One comes away reading this book with little or no doubt as to who's been right and who's been wrong. The method the author uses for this is very difficult to take issue with. It's basically a timeline of who said what when (based on public record), whether they stayed consistent, or whether they backtracked or contradicted themselves after the fact.<br /><br />Even if you agree with Krugman (as many do), it's startling and worthwhile to see how his writings have evolved over time, and how many mistakes he's made with his economic predictions and refused to acknowledge. While this may not be the best reflection on the opposing economic theories, it is a good reflection on the two individuals. I highly recommend it."
881,1451606958,5,"I usually avoid this kind of novel.  You know the kind:  a misunderstanding occurs between lovers and then pages and pages unfold with them being cruel to each other when you know if they would just sit down and talk like adults for five minutes it would clear the way to their HEA.  But they don't talk except in bitter recriminations and it just wears me out.<br /><br />For the first time I understand the beauty of this kind of novel when it is well written.  Adrian and Nora are parted by family when they are barely out of their teens.  The usual lies have been told leading to bitterness in both partners.  But in Ms. Durans's competent hands this is more heart breaking than irritating.  She has the grace not to drag out the Great Misunderstanding until you are gritting your teeth.  The lies are revealed fairly early leading to Adrian understanding and letting his love rise to the occasion.  And this is where it REALLY gets good.<br /><br />I like characters with a bit of a dark side.  Once Adrian sees where he wants to go he has no problem dragging Leonora with him, even against her will.  These are dangerous times and Adrian is willing to have his beloved angry with him if it keeps her safe.  Who wouldn't sigh over a hero like this?  She remains pig headed a little longer than necessary but her refusal to see the light is well reasoned, her concerns are based on love for her family and not just hard feelings.  This is a very well written story.<br /><br />Duran really excells in descibing this time in English history.  There is a plot to put a Catholic King on the throne and the story vibrates with the tension of traitorous plots, political maneuvering at court and the inherent intriques that keep you on the edge of your seat.  By the time our lovers sail into their happy future they have definitely earned it."
882,B0064X7FH8,5,"I really loved this book - I like the idea she proposes here that our bodies need different approaches to eating, exercise, nutrition, etc based on the season. I personally feel my own body is different in the freezing of winter as opposed to the heat of summer.<br /><br />I found the book an easy read and I like that she takes the few chapters to discuss the ins and outs of what's important and why and the health effects. I did feel that this was more of a detox/health plan as opposed to a weight loss plan - but, weight loss is obvious to follow when eliminating processed foods and sugar and junk carbs from your diet. I bought it more for the detox/cleansing information, so I was okay with that. Don't let that sway you if you want the diet angle, she most definitely gives great information on some natural supplements to aid in that respect.<br /><br />I did find it a bit tedious the idea of SO many supplements that she continuously suggests you buy through her website. It irked me a bit. Finally when I was to the step where I wanted to get the items to begin the plan, I went to her website and looked at the ingredient lists and dosages ( took me about 5 - 10 minutes ) and then shopped for alternatives elsewhere. Found all the stuff at a reputable health food/supplement site and got it a fraction of the cost. But, some was stuff I already use - like protien powders and pre-and pro- biotics. So yes, this could be a pricey plan for you, but if you take a little time and shop around you could easily do this plan for a very reasonable price. I think mine was (including the items I already use) maybe $100 for about 6 - 8 months. The health site I use does a bogo or a buy2get3 deal. As far as foods go - cheap. If you already buy produce regularly - no real game changer to your pocket book. Actually cheaper for us because I don't buy any of the junk foods now. I also don't go buy the sea plants and use the spice blend instead - didn't buy that from her site either ( $1.99online - lol ) so I guess there could be added expense there - her point is get the iodine and there is no way I will get my family to eat seaweed 3 night a week.<br /><br />It is prep heavy as someone else said....however, so is any healthy eating plan. You name a diet and I am sure it suggests having snacks and meal items prepped and ready so you make healthy choices. I don't mind the prep or cooking - i do it anyway as we already eat pretty healthy. Though I would agree that the recipes are something to be desired. The easy stuff seemed to be fine, but I would love if this had a more practical approach for the many people who don't want to cook 2 seperate meals. i mean I have kids, some of the recipes are pretty time and ingredient intensive. Though the metabolism soup is a favorite for us.<br />Having said that, easy fix. There are a myriad of fantastic recipe sites out there, most of which you can search by the ingredients you want to put in. OPened up many more options that were more time friendly and dare I say...tastier. Definitely made up my mind to not buy the recipe book she has. Also found that a lot of the \\""special\\"" items - chia, protien powders, etc could easily go in juice from the juicer or in the blender with fruit and make a smoothie.<br /><br />All in all some great info in this book, would just like to see her acknowledge the many men and women who can not have seperate foods and meals from their family - ie. make it more family friendly for busy moms and dads. You will feel better if you follow the plan and you will lose weight - but the focus is on healthy  lifestyle and overall well being here. She definitely takes an approach of nurturing many aspects of your well being with use of massage, aromatherapy and yes - a hot quiet bath a few times a week.<br /><br />I would recommend her other book on parasites as an additional read. Read a library copy while doing this plan. Parasites are in EVERYBODY. This isn't weirdo health nut stuff, it's infoyou can get from the AMA or the CDC. But, her book is very concise and informative. Just bought a copy to keep from Amazon this week. I say this because parasites are fed by the sugary, starchy processed diet we have in this country. You can get them from produce, meat, the beach, your pet and even pools. I was disgusted when I found out that chlorine has no effect on some of them and that there are always outbreaks in the summer here in the US. And they cause all kinds of digestive problems and can inhibit weight loss. So good info to have as you approach a new healthier you."

Creo que es importante decir que el libro, dentro de su trama, es EXCELENTE, más la traducción que han hecho de él fue hecha en un español muy regional que utiliza frases y modismos ajenos al idioma aplicado mundialmente. Esto hace que su disfrute sea mermado.<br /><br />Empezando desde la portada, donde publican un anillo con piedra roja (pienso que es un rubí), pero la joya de la trama tiene una gran esmeralda (que sabemos es de color verde)<br /><br />Yo recomendaría a quiénes estén interesados en este producto, comprarlo en inglés, porque la traductora, en mi opinión, no le hizo mucho favor a la obra."
884,1857885783,5,".<br />Reviewed by C J Singh (Berkeley, California)<br /><br />Recently, I posted a review of the new edition of Jurgen Wolff's [[ASIN:1857885775 Your Writing Coach]].  Throughout that book,  Wolff sustained an encouraging and witty tone as he does in his latest book, YOUR CREATIVE WRITING MASTERCLASS.<br /><br />The masterclass book comprises six parts. In Part I, Finding Inspiration, Wolff briefly quotes from several master-writers including Faulkner, Marquez, and Nabokov; for example, Nabokov recommends poetry: \\""You have to saturate yourself with English poetry in order to compose English prose\\"" (page 3).  Wolff concludes with \\""From Advice to Action\\"" -- a feature in every chapter that greatly enhances the book: use your camera to take \\""interesting visual images\\""; \\""jot down snatches of overheard conversation\\""; and fill in the gaps of your story idea by imagining your being interviewed and answering questions about \\""different aspects of the story.\\""<br /><br />Part II, Characters Come to Life, cites brief selections from Austen, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Kundera, and Welty among others. Wolff advises: using a questionnaire, interview your character (pages 40-42); using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, identify your characters' needs and wants (page 47-48); identify your own dark side by listing what \\""bothers you most about other people\\"" and use these traits to \\""humanize\\"" your characters (page 55); \\""cultivate the art of discreet eavesdropping (page 76); and \\""integrate the description of the setting\\"" with characterization (page 86).<br /><br />Part III, Shaping the Story, begins with an exposition of various points of view. Next, whether to plan or not to plan the story: planners cited include Edgar Allan Poe, PG Wodehouse. Wolff coins a new term \\""spontaneists\\"" to describe writers who don't plan and cites Edward Albee and Stephen King among them. (\\""Spontaneists\\"" sounds much better than \\""bottom-uppers\\"" would have been as derived from the bottom-up/top-down typology.) Among the in-betweeners, he cites Paul Auster, Michael Chabon, and Amy Tan (pages 106-107).<br /><br />Part IV, Finding Your Style, begins by noting that \\""there are some elements on which many of the master writers agree\\"" such as clarity, conciseness, and evocative details.<br /><br />Part V, The Process, cites master-writers like Mark Twain, James Thurber, and Joyce Carol Oates on their processes of writing. On dealing with dread, Alice Munro:\\""In writing, I've always had a lot of confidence, mixed with dread that the confidence is entirely misplaced. I think in way that my confidence came just from being dumb\\"" (page 215). This from one of the very best contemporary short-story writers! And here's from one of the very best screenwriters, William Goldman: \\""I don't know how it is for others, but building up confidence is the single hardest battle I face every day of my life\\"" (page 214).<br /><br />In Part VI, The Writing Life, Wolff advises establishing a writing routine, rationing time for surfing the internet, and concludes: \\""Ultimately, the writers who are the happiest are the ones find joy in the process of writing and don't make their happiness contingent on being published, getting rave reviews, or basking in adoration from the reading public\\"" (page 260).<br /><br />This book is a masterly introduction to the creative writing craft.betweeners, he cites Paul Auster, Michael Chabon, and Amy Tan (pages 106-107).<br /><br />Part IV, Finding Your Style, begins by noting that \\""there are some elements on which many of the master writers agree\\"" such as clarity, conciseness, and evocative details.<br /><br />Part V, The Process, cites master-writers like Mark Twain, James Thurber, and Joyce Carol Oates on their processes of writing.

886,0899429106,5,"This is an excellent and compact prayer book.  It contains many great and wonderful prayers that can be used for every day life.  I especially appreciated the part in the back where the basics of the Catholic faith are explained.  This makes it easy to evangelize when you have a handy little reference for the basics of Catholic belief right in the back of a prayer book.  If you are like me, you probably will carry this with you wherever you go.  I always have it on hand when in waiting rooms and such so I can spend my time waiting in prayer.<br /><br />This book is very nice.  It has some general basic prayers such as an Act of Faith, an Act of Hope, an Act of Love, and an Act of Contrition.  It also contains an Act of Spiritual Communion.  But not only this it also shows you how to pray the Rosary with each set of mysteries, including the Luminous Mysteries I believe, for each day of the week.  It even has a little Way of the Cross in it that you can use to pray the Way of the Cross at home.<br /><br />Personally, I love this prayer book.  I had lost two of them and had to come back and order another copy and I am so glad I did.  This is a handy little reference for many different prayers.  I think you will love this prayer book as much as I do."
887,0375711325,4,"I have read the second edition a few times.  I don't have the third.  It is a fine book.  It is a synthesis for the general reader, with all that goes with that.  It is hard to write such a book well, and he does it very well.  If I remember right he provides a quite middle-of-the-road view.  Doesn't overstate the good or the bad, dwells more on political and military matters than the rest."
888,0615572774,5,"In this wonderful book, Belle takes the \\""veil\\"" off the common belief that we are our stories and therefore somehow bound to them.  While this is certainly one way to live, it is not the way to experience true happiness, true love and true peace.  I highly recommend this book-- worth every penny-- and the information contained within it, priceless!"

891,0820328480,5,I have the original book which is held together with duct tape it's been read so many times. It's a wonderful story and one of my favorite books.  I LOVE IT!  Read it and enjoy!
892,1579654258,5,"This really is a beautiful book visually as well as very informative.  The author provides all of the science behind making dyes...not just which plants (with pictures of the plants as well as of the yarns they've dyed...in multiple shades with explanation of how to get each shade) but also which season to find the plants, which part of the plant to use, which bases to use for which results, how to seal the color, how to find the needed materials etc.<br /><br />The book is well laid out, the pictures are attractive, the book is good quality, and the information is solid.  It is great to see the before and after pictures of the wool dyed to see the actual results from the processes explained.  There is also a good index and a list of suppliers in the back and the author gives credit to her sources.  The only things I could have asked further are  1)more plant selection...(even just a list without details of how to use them) of other plants that are viable since some of these plants are very limited in their native areas; and 2) how to mix dyes for greater color range.  This seems to be a thorough start though and is beautiful beside."

894,B0055X6M9A,4,"Carter does a thorough review of Obama's views on war using Obama's Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech as a starting point.  The book is organized into 4 sections: the concept of a just war, the just conduct of war, the defense of strangers meaning non-national defense wars and recognition of the US political discussion about war and its conduct.<br /><br />While Carter's approach is logically analytic, he is an apologist for Obama's approach after taking office.  He contrasts Obama's actions as President and his words as the Peace Candidate. He acknowledges that Obama's approach has been to ramp up the violence over the George W. Bush approach but provides justification and reasoning for doing so.  In the first chapter Carter repeatedly references to the writings of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas plus Catholic Theological thinking.  He summarizes a Just War as containing elements of a just cause, last resort, legitimate authority, reasonable hope of success, proportionaltiy and discrimination.  Carter then elaborates on the meaning of each and provides examples.<br /><br />In Chapter 2 Carter acknowledges Obama's about face on the violent conduct of war and compares ideas on just conduct in war with Obama's choices.  He seeks to answer the question of why have Obama's choices differed from his pre-election words.  Examples include pre- and post election Obama on rendition, remote missle strikes and secret military operations.  Carter gives us the summary justifications \\""..the President and his senior staff were 'stunned' by the threats spread before them at their first postelection briefings on national security.\\""  And \\""No Peace Candidate has ever become a Peace President.\\""  These glib explanations as justifications contrast with the didactic approach of the rest of the book,and they are more damning of the Obama Presidency than comforting.  My conclusion is that Candidate Obama was either naive or manipulative in his campaigning.<br /><br />In Chapter 2 Carteralso discusses Obama's embracing of assassination of both non-Americans and Americans.  This deserves its own Chapter.  Since President Gerald Ford, an Executive Order prohibited assassination of foreign nationals.  Carter argues that Obama is not bound by the prior President's Executive Order.  So Obama's stated strategy includes assassination of both Americans and non-Americans at \\""...his (Obama's) discretion...\\""  In my view, Carter's passivity on assassination degrades his apologia to that of alibi.<br /><br />Chapter 3 covers war in cooming to the aid of other nations, where the issue of US national defense is murkey and debatable.  What are the conditions under which just war theory permits such actions. He articulates Obama's varied responses.<br /><br />Chapter 4 covers the \\""American Proviso\\"" in which he details the balance of national political demands and just war theory.<br /><br />The strength of Carter's book is justification for and discussion of the contrasts between Obama's words in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech which is included and his actions as President.  Carter provides the argument for Obama's actions.  In this Carter is thorough and logical.  At issue is that the disparity between the Candidate and the President are substantial.  This must reading for everyone who wants to evaluate the President."
895,1930004672,5,"As you will read, it started out as an innocent question. What resulted was this tremendous book. Reginald Haupt has done an amazing job of utilizing the Masonic Lodge's own materials to expose the heinous beliefs and rituals that occur. Freemasonry is not only a secret society, but is also paganism with its religion based on ancient Egyptianism. Mr. Haupt does a fabulous job comparing Christianity to Masonry, concluding that they are diametrically opposed. No true Christian can be a member of the Lodge. In this book you will discover the structure of Freemasonry, its degrees, initiations, and the symbolism. I highly recommend everyone read this informative book to learn the truth about the Masonic Lodge."
896,0316175676,5,"Who knew a book about Alaska could be so interesting? The Snow Child tells the story of a marriage of two people who are at a loss; both desperately wanted a child, but at this point in their lives it is too late to have one. They move to Alaska, hoping to rekindle the love they once shared while at the same time building an entirely new life for themselves. Mabel and Jack one day encounter a child who appears almost as if by magic. Her name is Faina and she is much like the snow child Mabel read about as a young girl. They welcome Faina into their home, and she grows up with them, becoming a part of their family and building a life of her own.<br /><br />What is so wonderful about this story is its ability to sound true to life even with its elements of impossible magic. If if it is real, then the reader must confront the possibility that magic may exist. The author does a beautiful job of keeping the words together like poetry, very much like the prairie stories of Willa Cather. This story is captivating and invigorating, and it may breathe life into the heart of someone who no longer believes in fairy tales. If you haven't read a good book in a while, I cannot recommend this one more. It is magic in itself, a gem of a book that has every sentence overflowing with sentiment and fantasy."
897,1455508446,5,"Worth it....Not Worth It delivers a huge return on two of our most valuable assets: time and money.<br />The format requires very little of the former. Otter aims for brevity over War and Peace length explanations. You've got questions about personal finance? Otter's got the answers, fast and sweet, but with just enough explanation to give you confidence he knows what the heck he's talking about. It's also a fun read, which should qualify it for some special award given how dry personal finance can be. And as for the money angle...Well, I haven't done the math, but conservatively I bet following just half the advice in this book could save you more than six figures over your lifetime. Worth it Not Worth It is worth it for anyone looking to get on top of their financial life. But it strikes me as especially spot on for any recent college grad you might know: Start out in the real world with Otter showing you the way on the money front and you're gonna be just fine."
898,1149382627,5,"\\""Pandosto\\"" (later given the name \\""The Pleasant History of Dorastus and Fawntia\\"") ) was a romantic novel published in 1588 and written by Robert Greene, reminiscent of Lyly's works.  It is important today mainly as it is the acknowledged source of Shakespeare's \\""The Winter's Tale\\"" which was written/performed about 1610. In 1610, Greene had been dead for some 17 years.  Most critics call him a talented writer who just wasted his talent and career on booze and sinful living.  So much for those Oxies who believe that a writer's life must be reflected in his works.  Greene was a dissolute, deceitful, debauchee, who was dishonest, left his wife and his child after he spent her money, and ended up living in the street, before a poor shoe-maker took pity on him and brought him to live in his house, where his wife tended upon him; also living there were two women, one a sister of \\""Cutting Ball\\"" a local nasty thief, and who bore him an illegitimate son named Fortunatus (one of his favorite words in Pantosto is \\""fortunate\\"", or \\""fortune\\"").  On his deathbed he writes a letter to his deserted wife to forgive him and to pay all of his debts. Nice guy. And writer of all of those romances.  He and Shakespeare were definitely not cut from the same cloth.<br /><br />1.)  Most historians give him the honor of being the first of University Wits to acknowledge Shakespeare's presence in London in 1593, by warning the others, Marlowe, Nash, Peele, and the rest of the \\""upstart Crow\\"" \\""beautifying himself with our Feathers.\\""<br /><br />2.  Why would Shakespeare pick a Greene novel to turn into one of his last plays? Interesting question.  Did HE really feel that it make a good play.  Did he read it years ago, or did one of the actors suggest it that it would make a good play to present in the Blackfriar's small stage?  Did Shakespeare take on the challenge with this in mind, or that the Oxford/Cambridge Greene had been dead for about two decades, but that HE, was the best known playmaker in London, who had abandoned iambic pentameter's bombastic verse, and revolutionized theater in London, so that characters actually sounded like real people?<br /><br />3.)  Apparently, many of those horrendous errors of geography (like Bohemia having a coastline) and anachronisms were in Greene's novel, and simply copied into \\""Winter's Tale\\"", Shakespeare probably not knowing the errors, and even if he did, not caring about those thing, something that drove his friend Jonson nuts (and the 16 year span in the play!!).<br /><br />4.)  How does Shakespeare, or any playwright, take the prose form novel, and tun it into a stage play, movie script, or teleplay.  Reading Greene, most is expressed in prose of course, with a few monologues, which are tedious and too long for a novel.  Shakespeare dropped some of them, shorted some, and of course, expressed prose through dialogue between actors.<br /><br />5.)  Shakespeare changed the character's names, but not the countries, Sicily and Bohemia.  Why he did not change the countries also is an interesting question, but certainly not pertinent.<br /><br />In any case, it is an fascinating exercise for those reasons. \\""Winter's Tale\\"" was no \\""Tempest\\"", and one wonders why Shakespeare ever took the time to write it.  Talk about a \\""revenge\\"" play...."
899,080509153X,4,"In October 1859, John Brown and a small, multi-racial group of his followers occupied parts of the federal armory and arsenal in Harper's Ferry, Virginia (now in West Virginia).  In the next few hours they took some hostages and freed some of the slaves of hostages (one of whom had a family connection to George Washington).  Despite considerable confusion, the local townspeople and local Virginia militia quickly surrounded the raiders in the buidings they occupied - a detail about which I had been previously unaware.  U. S. army officer Robert E. Lee, assisted by Jeb Stuart, then crushed the resistance with a few score Marines.  Most of those raiders who were not already killed were captured and hanged a few months later after trials in Virginia courts.  A few members of Brown's party, mainly those who were in Maryland waiting to bring up supplies, survived the events.<br /><br />John Brown had previously become notorious for several killings of pro-slavery men in Kansas, during the period when there was conflict in that territory over the issue of slavery being legal once it became a state, an issue which thanks to Senator Douglas of Illinois was left up to the citizens of the territory.  Brown's apparent motive for killing them was a raid by pro-slavery forces on the anti-slavery town of Lawrence, Kansas.<br /><br />One question is what exactly Brown hoped to achieve in Harper's Ferry.  His previous plans had generally suggested a vast raid to free slaves; but his immobility once he occupied parts of the armory and arsenal are inconsistent with this plan.  Horwitz makes the reasonable suggestion that the raid was intended as a combination suicide mission and publicity stunt, designed to increase tension between the north and south to spark a conflict over slavery.  The one point I would make against this hypothesis is that if that is all that Brown wanted to accomplish, it was unnecessary to stockpile all those pikes, revolvers and carbines in preparation for theraid.  Perhaps Brown himself was of two minds regarding his plans.<br /><br />In any case, the month Brown had between his sentence of death and his hanging in December 1859 gave him time add to publicity value of his raid.  He wrote many letter and received many visitors. The successful efforts of Virginia's governor to involve himself in the affair also increased the attention given to the events.<br /><br /> Brown's raid probably made it easier for succession to occur upon the election of Lincoln, by changing people's attitudes.  Southern politicians often took Brown's raid, and the sympathy he received from many in the north, as evidence that northern opinion was really uncompromisingly abolitionist.<br /><br />The narrative's pace can be a slow, mainly because Horwitz writes about what Brown was doing before he became a violent anti-slavery activist.  Overall, I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I have published a very similar review at goodreads.com"

901,1613743416,4,"This book is my toughest review yet. I feel like I just read something profound and important, but I can't quite grasp exactly WHY I feel that way.<br /><br />Roadside Picnic is a refreshingly unique book. I feel odd using the word 'refreshingly' for what's considered a classic, but that's the only word I can use to describe it.<br />The plot is amazingly genius--Like nothing I've ever read before. I mean, c'mon...Aliens have visited the earth and left behind....stuff. Alien stuff that no one knows exactly what to do with. But some of it is worth a LOT of money...and some of it is deadly.<br />To get to the good stuff, you have to brave the deadly stuff. Like, literally crawl through slimy puddles of deadly guck-stuff.<br />How cool is THAT??<br /><br />Because the novel begins awhile after the actual alien visit, I almost felt like I'd started a book in the middle, which was a bit distracting.<br />For the first quarter of the novel I felt a bit lost, but the story sucked me in after that and my brain quickly adjusted. ;)<br /><br />The characters didn't exactly jump out at me, and I didn't really feel invested in them at all, but again, the story grabs you and keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />The best parts were the journey's into the Zone. That's when your heart starts to race and your palms get sweaty and you stay up way past bedtime to find out what happens next. ;)<br /><br />This translation is just okay. You can definitely tell it's a translation and, at times, that's distracting. The words don't 'flow' as well as they could and sometimes there's a choppy-feeling as you're reading.<br /><br />But!<br />Because this is classic sci-fi and the story itself is just so amazing, I definitely recommend Roadside Picnic to all sci-fi lovers.<br />It's most definitely worth the read, and I'd REALLY love to discuss this book with like-minded geeks! ;)<br />There's a TON of fodder in this book that would make for some great debates and conversations!"

904,1580054080,5,"Beautiful book, with a great variety of stories dealing with almost every possible aspect of being a curvy girl. what i found endearing is the embracing or the \\""curviness\\"" by the characters. So often now we have an ideal body image that is impossible to live up to, and we forget the very real beauty that can be found in curves. The 19 stories themselves are varied and i feel balanced well enough with colorful and relatable characters and very steamy, sensual sex. This book is not about any specific kink or fetish rather it is an appreciation of curvy girls and those who love them, and in that is is different than other anthologies out there. is is a very sweet and loving tribute to women of all sizes."

The item description (demensions, amount of stickers, etc) is exactly what you get. A pocket sized book of stickers perfect for a party favor for little boys or girls. Or, a sticker book to throw in your diaper bag as a distraction for your little one at dinner or a wedding or wherever they might need a distraction. Or just a simple little book of stickers just for your child to enjoy. And, at $1 a piece, who can complain? So enjoy!"
907,1600611931,5,"I found this book not only inspiring, but really helpful for painting large floral watercolors that almost pop off the paper.<br /><br />There are some useful techniques in the book, as well as, of course, gorgeous paintings to admire. The techniques include composition, which for me is formost--what you paint, what you leave OUT, how you arrange your subject is probably the thing that gives the biggest impact, yet it is  sometimes a subtle thing.<br /><br />The author's style is bold and harder than I typically paint, but if you want big florals with huge color, you can follow pages of her process to create a painting. Note that she uses a photographic technique, that is, the background colors can be fuzzed exactly as you would see from a camera lens on close up, with a short depth of field. Sometimes I find this a bit odd, as it's not how the brain sees things, it's how a camera does, but even so, it's effective for paintings of ultra-realism.<br /><br />The best part of the book is on color. This artist is a master of strong, saturated, amazing color and that is sometimes hard to achieve in watercolor, where darker colors can become muddy or confused on the paper. She shows you how to reserve the all-important sparkling whites, and to choose a palette for maximum impact. Negative space is well handled--this is another technique you really have to master for watercolor.<br /><br />I did a few paintings using this book as a guide, and though they are outside my normal, more loose method to do florals, I was pleased with the results and I ended up with a few hibiscus paintings I had to do on request from a relative, who wanted something for her Florida home.<br /><br />Even if you paint in a different way (less ultra-real, let's say) this book has value in the color chapters and the composition discussion."
908,0849948290,3,"Dr. Richard Lee issues a clarion call to the citizens of this great country, the call is loud and clear it's time to wake up, stand up, and speak up.  Dr. Lee parallels history with our current political, social, economic climate.  He uses past success and failures to script a plan of action for us today.  It has been stated before that if we don't learn from history, then history will repeat itself.<br />I personally found this book to be eye opening, encouraging, and inspiring.  The author looks into recent movements such as the Tea Party and Occupy Movement, which gives readers insight into the true purpose and motives of both movements.  The reality is the main stream media has played a tremendous role in shaping the opinions and ideas of the American people as it relates to politics, in particular this current political climate.  As we stand on the brink of a critical election year, this book is not only extremely important but essential in setting inaccurate reporting straight and opening the eyes of the American voters as they compare and contrast presidential candidates.<br />Historically, the great awakening is the moment in history when the American people awoke from their sleep and mobilized for freedom and liberty.  Dr. Lee suggests the same thing is happening with the tea party movement we see today.  \\""We the people\\"" are awakening from our slumber and standing up for freedom.  The freedom with seek isn't just for us, but it's for our children and our great grandchildren.  While there are some who are ashamed of the success of our country, I'm not.  I realize that God has set this land as a beacon of  light for the entire world to see what can happen when free people are able to be free.<br />Note: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze book review bloggers program.

Maureen Hancock is an angel from heaven who is here to spread the word that there really is life after death. I have had the privilege of seeing her in person and watching her touch so many lives and bring so many smiles back on faces that hadn't had one in too long! She brings you closer to your lost loved one's and let's you know that they really are still here, in spirit! I have witnessed Maureen first hand bring back loved one's...she can give names, dates and reasons. She will tell you things that only your loved one would know. She has a gift beyond anything else imaginable, the gift to talk to the one's we never thought we would be able to talk to again! She connects with them, using humor along the way. If I could afford to go to her shows daily, I would! Her shows and her book are well worth the money!!! I bought 4 of them for gifts and they were a huge hit, they have been passed around and shared by many people already. I am so grateful for Maureen to help others get through their worst times and worst fears and give them the gift of knowing that their lost loved one isn't as far away as we thought. In her book, she tells it all, like it is. She shares her powerful stories and you will not be able to put it down once you start it!!! Thank You Maureen for all you do for so many people!!!"

913,0691090092,4,"Law's Order was the primary text in my Economic Analysis of the Law class in law school, but I think it is sufficiently accessible for the layman, which is why I'm taking the time to review it.  It's the rare book that can be read cover-to-cover and used as a reference with equal success.  His target audience in mind (math-phobic law students), Friedman (son of Milton) has stripped the main text of formulas (and, more unfortunately, charts) while leaving markers to indicate where you may find the math on his website.  Friedman's prose is informal, (relatively) jargon-free, and interspersed with regular allusions to Vikings, Redcoats, and the King's Messengers to liven things up (Friedman is an ardent recreational medievalist and has written a fantasy novel).<br /><br />Law's Order consists of an extensive introduction to economics as it applies to the law followed by chapters devoted to specific areas of the law (e.g., intellectual property, contracts, etc.)  Most of the major areas are covered, although constitutional law (admittedly an immature branch of law & economics), agency law, and business associations are omitted.  Game theory is given a cursory look, and public choice (assuming you don't categorize the entirety of law & economics as public choice) and behavioral law & economics are absent.  But public choice at least certainly deserves an entire book of its own.  As would be expected given Friedman's outside interests, ample historical context is provided.<br /><br />The central dilemma of a survey of law & economics is that there is just so much to cover.  That is Law's Order's ultimate failing.  Some very valuable topics aren't covered (business associations) and others aren't given proper attention (intellectual property, which is probably worthy of a few chapters).  Charts are in my mind a must have in any economics textbook, even one aimed at text-friendly lawyers.  A website can only do so much to remedy this, and Friedman's website isn't much to speak of.<br /><br />But those are the sort of things that separate very, very good from perfect.  This is still the first book I recommend to anyone looking for an introduction to law & economics (perhaps paired with a public choice primer like Government Failure by Tullock).eak of.<br /><br />But those are the sort of things that separate very, very good from perfect.

915,1463759371,5,"This book came at a critical time in my journey.  The author provides an incredible level of detail in his scholarship revealing the first century understanding of the Word of God.  Unlike the contemporary understanding of the Word, which is restricted to the written text of scripture, Service unravels the understanding of the Biblical writers of the Word as that encounter with God, whether through dreams, visions, word of knowledge or whatever forms that this encounter might take, that brings life to the recipient of this God encounter (Word).  The book is packed with impeccable scholarship that will radically and forever alter the reader's understanding of what the Gospel of Jesus is really all about.  In my opinion, this is a book that should be a must read for every student of the gospel, whether professional or laity."

917,0553593382,5,"Jennifer Crusie has long been one of my favorite authors, and I have pretty much everything she's written. So I was beyond excited when I came across this book at a library sale and realized it was one I'd not read yet. I put it on the shelf, not intending to read it right away as I already have so many books lined up, but it began taunting me, \\""read me, you know you want to, trust me on this!\\"" So I finally dove in, and oh, it was worth it. Jennifer Crusie never disappoints.<br /><br />Dennie Banks is a reporter, looking for that elusive big story that will make her career, but stuck at a small time paper where she covers weddings and such. Alec Prentiss works for the government, investigating fraud, and currently targeting a grifter who pulls real estate scams. Alec and his boss have been after this guy for a long time, and desperately want to bring him in.<br /><br />Dennie and Alec wind up at the same hotel for a convention, where Alec has spotted his target and is determined to set him up and reel him in. Meanwhile, Dennie has gotten a scoop about an esteemed professor who is at the convention, but the professor doesn't want to be interviewed and complains to hotel management that Dennie is stalking her. Alec happens to know the professor, who is a friend of his aunt, who is also at the hotel.<br /><br />When their paths cross, Alec thinks Dennie is working for the scam artist and cozying up to her will get him closer to the target, and Dennie thinks cozying up to Alec, who seems to be a bit of a nerdy goofball, is the key to getting the interview of her life.<br /><br />In a note to readers at the front of the book, Crusie describes this as the only screwball comedy she's ever written. While I'm not sure I quite agree, as I love screwball comedy and I love all of her books, which all have wonderfully humorous and at times screwballish scenes in them, this is definitely screwball in the way some of the greatest old movies are. I was captivated from the beginning. I loved the banter between Dennie and Alec, and the way they were so attracted to each other but bound and determined to ignore and/or fight that attraction and just use each other for their respective purposes. And of course it all ended just the way it should have..

918,0385738609,4,"Ryan has this amazing way with words. Starting with the first book, I was drawn in by her introductions. I was pleasantly surprise that she kept it going in the later books. Even if a few short sentences, she sets the stage for the story without giving anything away or pushing too hard. It also sets the narrator's tone and pace of the novel.<br /><br />All of the previous books follow a different character in the story post Return. In The Dead-Tossed Waves, the story picks up with Mary's daughter, Gabry. With the way the book ended, I hoped that it would resume with Gabry and Catcher finding the Dark City; however, it is told from Annah's point of view. Since she left her sister on the path in the forest, her and Elias have been living in Dark City. Barely surviving, Elias enters the Recruiters with a promised to return after the required two year tour. The story picks up three years later. Annah is surviving in the Dark City without word from Elias. All she can presume is that he is dead. Not seeing any point in staying, Annah packs up her meager belonging and heads toward the gates to leave Dark City. However, on her way out, she sees her mirror image crossing the bridge to enter the City. Unfortunately, she is escorted by the Recruiters to the Sanctuary.<br /><br />After reading this book, I'm not sure if Gabry is my favorite narrator. I adored Annah. She is a strong character. Even though the audience sees her wallowing in self pity, the book is not filled with this. On the contrary, I felt it helped make Annah a sympathetic character and allowed the author to show the major growth she under goes as a character. In this series, the author does an amazing job showing growth and development in her characters. This includes most of the supporting characters.<br /><br />Ryan also has an amazing way to flesh out her backgrounds. She describes the scenery enough to give the reader and idea, but she allows the reader to fill in the details. When Annah was trapped in the cage, I started to feel extremely claustrophobic! It is amazing when an author is able to elicit such responses from her readers.<br /><br />The only problem I had in the book was the ease with which they creating the hot air balloons. I wanted to know how the surviving residents of Dark City were able to make all of the propellers. In addition, I felt that it was a little too forgiving to allow Annah, Gabry, and Elias to create it in a vacuum. After Ox's pronouncement, it seemed ridiculous to assume that the Recruiters would leave the girls alone when Catcher would scrounge the City for supplies. I'm not sure how Ryan should have handled it; however, she made it much too easy.<br /><br />That aside, I enjoyed the book! I liked watching Annah grow. At several points, I found myself almost crying for her in her dealings with Elias. The ending scene in the tunnel showed the audience just how strong she was as a person.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this series! It reminds me a a combination of The Hunger Games and a zombie outbreak.e cage, I started to feel extremely claustrophobic!

926,146365877X,5,"I usually don't care much for mystery stories and I almost never read them, but something about this book caught my eye. I think it was the unique-looking cover combined with the idea of a protagonist with prosopagnosia, a condition that I've heard a little bit about in the past. I read the first few pages using the \\""look inside\\"" feature and liked what I read, so I took the plunge and ordered a copy of this book. I'm really glad that I did.<br /><br />David is a very likable main character with an interesting condition called prosopagnosia that makes it hard for him to recognize people. He ends up witnessing his best friend's murder, but is unable to identify the killer. This leads many people (the police, kids at school, even his own father) to believe that he is lying and using his prosopagnosia as an excuse to cover up for the murderer. When a boy comes forward and claims to be the killer, David knows that he isn't telling the truth and decides to look for the real murderer on his own. Throughout the course of the book, David has to deal with a lot of harassment from other people as well as his own frustrations while he works on solving his friend's murder.<br /><br />I enjoyed trying to figure out who the real killer was, but I ended up being completely wrong! World Without Faces is a well written story with a great moral point. I think just about anyone, from older kids to adults, would enjoy this story. I highly recommend it to mystery fans as well as those who don't usually like the genre, like myself. It's well worth the read!"

928,1565849434,1,"I don't give one stars ofter, but this book deserves it.  This is eight chapters of alternative history.  Some chapters read OK, but there are some real lies in this book.  For instance, Neale thinks that North Korea might not have invaded South Korea in 1950.  He really believes that the South Koreans invaded the North bringing about this war.  For those of us who read history, I was ready to put the book down at that point.<br /><br />On the Vietnam War, he paints the American soldiers as barbarians in their relations with South Vietnamese.  All the South Vietnamese soldiers were landlord sons, and members of an oppressive class.  Of course the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese didn't do any attrocities.  These were reserved for the Americans.  At the end, Neale tells us the soldiers did these barbarian things to please the ruling class in the United States.<br /><br />The final chapter is a real dowsy.  It does not even talk about the Vietnam War, but all the bad things America did to the world since 1975.  Of course, he reserves praise for the globalization protesters in Seattle in 1999.  They smashed up Seattle, but the author says they proved their points.<br /><br />I wanted to learn something about a leftist's view on a turning point in American history.  What I got was some opinionated talk about the crimes of America and why socialism and communism really do work.<br /><br />This book is opinion, and not history.

Well Mr. Burden does such a great job in statistical analysis of the Nazi Party Rallies, but he also does such a great job in portraying the mass psychology involved with any kind of political rally and how hundreds of thousands of people could be whipped into a frenzy over sick and sadistic ideals.  I read this book and I could see so many relations to our current rallies involved with the Socialist leaning DNC and the Neo-Con Fascist RNC.

934,0375859551,5,"Ohmygosh. Must not gush. I seriously loved this book. Even famous bookstore The Strand makes a few appearances! I heard about this novel when it was still an ARC but I didn't actually get around to reading it a few weeks ago. Told from alternating viewpoints, D&L's BoDs is a story of two bookish teens with very different lives who may or may not be destined for love. The character development was so thorough that I have to believe the authors both left little peices of themselves in each character. Rachel wrote from Lily's perspective and David from Dash's so I am going to tell myself this is totally possible. Plus, how cool is it that the authors intermittently wrote the chapters without much coordination or communication just like the character did? That takes talent my friends.<br /><br />I have to say, I loved these characters. Lily is innocent as a result of her family's well-intentioned over protection and Dash is...snarly, to borrow the description from the book, from having to learn so many life lessons the hard way. But both characters are intelligent, flawed, human, and wonderful in their own ways. Dash is the guy that will take your drunk butt home and not make a move, Lily is the girl that will buy a bag of Snickers for a homeless man and bake you cookies at Christmas. And Sofia, Dash's sort of ex, you will want to hate her for Lily's sake but she's actually quite likable. With unique and believable subordinates and two main characters who lives are bound to collide, Cohn and Levithan's latest collaboration is an entertaining, thought-provoking novel that will have readers cheering for Dash and Lily. Even now I am thinking about some of the more profound things they wrote to each other and how complicated and wonderful new love can be. Bravo Cohn and Levithan, bravo.<br /><br />Confession: I have neither read nor seen Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist...anyone want to comment and tell me if you think I will like it as much as this book?<br /><br />Classroom Use: 14+ Great novel for collaborative writing projects.

936,0670023329,5,"After reading this harrowing story of brutality at the hands of the North Korean government I am incensed that I have not, and we as a nation, have not done more to help these people.  I seriously wonder what future generations will think of us for our lack of action.  I have always truly believed that it is the duty of the strong to protect the weak and to not do so due to it being economically inconvenient, our own fear, or due to political interests will condemn us to the harsh, and warranted, judgments handed down by our children and our children's children.  When they ask, what were you doing what will you say?  \\""I wanted to help in some way but then became too preoccupied with the latest iPad?\\""  (I am not condemning you as much as myself for this.)<br /><br />I found it painful to read about the guilt felt by Shin due to his actions that he undertook for survival.  I understand why he feels it but honestly believe he had no choice.  An individuals instinct for survival is apparently the one thing that cannot be stripped from us no matter how harsh the circumstances.<br /><br />Ultimately I finished reading this feeling very lucky about where I was born and outraged that we, the UN/US and the world, let this occur.  It really makes you appreciate what you have and to know that no matter how hard life gets, it well never get as bad as it does for our fellow humans in North Korea.  I pray that God watches over them and grants us the strength to do something about their plight."

The next 400 pages are fiction in robust Boy's Own mode.  In fact the novel reads much like an adolescent adventure yarn, with violence, gunshot, tearing wounds, bows and arrows, scalping, torture and executions and brave men forced to take flight from the enemy. Four centuries pre Wild-west it belongs with Warlord comics.<br /><br />Although the presentation is immaculate, the language is heavily overloaded with modifiers and strained imagery. At times he novel fairly drips with violence and/or banality: `The boy was beside himself, jumping up and down like a rat on hot coals.'  Has our author ever witnessed such a thing, one wonders.  Then we have `the triumphant howls of savages' who all seem to be vindictive half-wits.  Clich&eacute; abounds -`grinding his teeth, growling like a wild dog' for instance - and every page is suffused with noise, violence and pain.  Definitely not for the sensitive soul.

945,1607012537,3,"In films, good acting can cover a multitude of sins, and in songwriting, a catchy, compelling tune can make up for lyrics written with a tin ear. Mechanique turns out to be an example of good writing compensating, to a degree, for a dodgy plot and opaque characterization. The story, which is a strange, but enjoyable, mix of fantasy, steampunk and post-apocalyptic grittiness, is about a circus peopled by half-human, half-mechanical performers. The owner of the circus, who's known only as Boss, is a stout, middle-aged woman who creates the performers and grants them a kind of immortality once she's taken out their bones and substituted ones made of brass and copper. The circus tours around a devastated landscape occupied by fortified towns and cities, all of them, it seems, at war with one another. The ruler of one city-state gets the bright idea that perhaps Boss can craft him some quasi-mechanical warriors. He imprisons Boss, and her circus performers must come to her rescue.<br /><br />Genevieve Valentine's writing style is best described as a blend of Ray Bradbury and William Faulkner. Like Bradbury, the fantastical elements in her story are presented in a melancholy and poetic manner. Most fantasy writers take an aggressive approach to describing their fantasy worlds, giving us a nuts and bolts description of how the magic works. Valentine is postively oblique in describing the fantasy elements. I was reminded of Faulkner because she constantly shifts the narrative perspective, as well frequently jumping back and forth along her story's timeline. She also has a Faulkner-like habit of building up her characters in layers; Faulkner wouldn't describe a character or emotion just once in a novel, he'd circle back multiple times to add more detail and definition. Valentine does the same thing, and her ability in this regard is admirable.<br /><br />Where Mechanique runs into trouble is that Valentine's interest in building up the backstory of the circus and its performers takes up far too much time. A lot of the writing about them is lovely, but the quantity of it leaves the novel almost plotless. The kidnapping of Boss is the only real event in the novel, and it's resolved in a not very original manner, with the circus performers using their extraordinary skills to storm the city she's being held in. The Dirty Dozen-ish finale feels predictable and far less imaginative than the rest of the novel.<br /><br />A lot of time and attention is devoted to the characters, but it doesn't always add up to people we understand. Boss, for example, remains a mystery to the end. We don't know how she got her magical powers or why she formed the circus. We get a good sense of how she relates to the performers, but nothing else. Other characters are almost as mysterious, and I sometimes got the feeling the author wants them to be that way, but in several cases their motivations and personal relationships become inscrutable because they've been described in such an elliptical manner.<br /><br />What saves the day for Mechanique is the prose, which is always sharp and fresh and atmospheric. Without going into a lot of detail or world-building, Valentine manages to create a very believable environment for her circus, and as unlikely as the circus is, it never feels like a farfetched effort in imagineering. If you're happy with a fantasy/sci-fi/steampunk novel that's mostly about mood and character, you'll enjoy this one. I'd have appreciated a better plot (any plot) and more coherent characters, but I still enjoyed it, mostly because good writing is rare enough that you have to be happy with it no matter what form it comes in.<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at JettisonCocoon dot com."
946,0062024043,5,"How does Roth do it? Somehow this author seamlessly combines world-shattering politics, hard-hitting action, and complex personal relationships, all in a novel-length piece that doesn't relent.<br /><br />And the twists, if anyone reads this and finds the ending predictable, I'm just going to have to give up now and stick to my day job. I confess I thought Roth was going to go down the typical '2nd book in a series cliffhanger' instead she just goes ahead and blows your mind completely!<br /><br />There isn't quite the same level of world building that I loved about Divergent (probably because the world was already built, or something) instead Roth mixes it up with what I can only describe as a psychological arms race between factions (or what's left of the factions) as Roth tears her world apart.<br /><br />Divergent is also free of awkward love-triangles, Roth focusses on making our key relationship slightly more deep and complicated than your average YA soppy-festival.<br /><br />Don't worry there are a few heavy scenes, just to keep ya/YA interested, but really Divergent is really a psychological piece about people as fractioned as their society.<br /><br />And in case you didn't realise RECOMMENDED"

Riveting and intense, The Rivals is everything I was looking for in a sequel.<br /><br />It had been awhile since I read The Mockingbirds, but within the first three pages of the book Daisy Whitney made me fall back in love with the world she has created with The Rivals. It was at this point, I was completely hooked and the only point in which I put it down was to go eat dinner. It was a book worthy of being carried with me as I walked around, rode the T, and anywhere else I needed to go.<br /><br />I loved that the plot was hard to guess - it was a bit of a mystery trying to figure out who was behind what. The Rivals is a whole new ball game after what happened in The Mockingbirds, and I really wasn't expecting any of it. I love the scenes between Martin and Alex - they are so adorable together.<br /><br />The cast of characters I grew to love in The Mockingbirds was only expanded in The Rivals. Not only do you get to know the characters from The Mockingbirds better, but a few new characters who are pretty fabulous are introduced.<br /><br />The Rivals by Daisy Whitney is a book to add to your must read pile.

954,1590524519,4,"Point: Preparing messages from the Bible takes dedication, skill, and devotion to the text.<br /><br />Path:  Giving an overview of three popular formats for sermons, topical, textual, and expository, Braga instructs the reader on preparing messages. He spends the majority of the book outlining how to prepare an expository message, but gives brief comments concerning the topical and textual messages.<br /><br />Agreement: Although there is a place for the topical sermon, I appreciated that he did not spend a great amount of time on it. Rather, he dedicated the majority of his time on the expository sermon, which seems to be the most beneficial for the church to partake of regularly. It takes a specific passage, asks what it means, and then seeks to communicate that truth to the hearer.<br /> Braga discusses several different ideas which were differently defined in Robinson's book. He deals with the proposition which is the main point of the passage (Robinson calls this the \\""subject\\"" I believe), then the Interrogative sentence (Robinson calls this the \\""compliment\\"") and then the transitional statement.<br /><br />Disagreement: A small quibble would be that the textual sermon seems quite similar to the expository message, but he contrasts them.<br /><br />Personal App: Braga's book is a helpful book, even though it was written nearly forty years ago. I believe one of the most beneficial areas of the book is its homework. If I were to teach a class, or mentor another man, I would consult this  book for ideas concerning homework and projects to complete.<br /> Braga also suggests that the preacher categorize illustrations as he comes across them. I don't use actually file folders in my compilation, however, I went through and added all his suggested folders into my sermon archive on my computer.<br /><br />It would be worth another read and I would recommend it. It receives 4 and not 5 stars because I found that [[ASIN:0801027985 Christ-Centered Preaching: Redeeming the Expository Sermon]] to be the most helpful I have read.

955,1937727157,3,"Review:<br />The only thing scarier than a Zombie Apocalypse is a Nation ruled by religion.<br /><br />Dead Things starts off nearly 20 years after a viral outbreak caused the dead to rise. Cities are closed off from each other and technology exists only in the most basic form. This world is ruled by the church, science is all but extinct and even doctors are limited in the scope to heal patients lest the Church lose it's grip on the masses. This scenario above all was the scariest part of the book and I have to control myself not to go into an epic rant about the stupidity of the population placing their lives in the church's hands. Once the massive book burning took place and those who even hinted at science being branded Heretics you think people would go hmmm this isn't a good thing.<br /><br />Anyway back to the review, I liked the character Van the best. He realized the world was screwed in its present state and didn't let the Church influence him. While I'm sure he had Faith in something he was a realist. On the other hand I didn't like the actual main character Ian. Even tough he goes through quite a personality change throughout the book I just never connected with him.<br /><br />Now for the things I didn't like about the book:<br /><br />The Zombies- I thought this was a zombie book but you barely see them. Gore, awesome zombie deaths nope not in this book. It was almost like the Author didn't know how to write the scenes so he just time jumped over them.<br /><br />The Random Rants- Several times throughout the book the characters go off on nonsensical rants about random bologna. This book tried way to hard to be like Clerks and Zombieland. It just didn't work at all.<br /><br />The Science- While the book makes it clear scientific reasoning has been all but expunged the characters seem to all be very knowledgeable about something they aren't allowed to use. Plus all the scientific talk really slowed down the pacing of this book.<br /><br />The Church- See Above. Plus I would of liked after all the survivors saw that they didn't end still in a church. I mean seriously?!? If you read this you will get what I mean.<br /><br />The Time Jumps- While time jumps can work, these just didn't 90% of the time. I felt again that the time jumps were used so that the Author didn't have to come up with ways to explain how Characters made it from Point A to B.<br /><br />Overall this book was a good effort which is the only reason why I am not rating it 2 Stars.

962,0982530129,5,"This is a review of both volumes<br /><br />Adam Novy's 'The Avian Gospels' is a novel that refuses to color in the lines. At no time while I was reading it could I say, this is literary fiction, dystopian fiction, political satire, myth, fable, fairy tale or love story. It is all these things and more and the whole is greater for it. The novel is set in a city that is suffering a plague of birds on a biblical scale and centered on a boy, Morgan, who can control them. Morgan and his father, who also has the power to control the birds, are opposed in their approaches to life under a regime, headed by Judge Giggs, which has all the worst elements of stalinist Russia, and monarchist France.<br /><br />Somehow, miraculously, in two small volumes, Novy manages to examine otherness, self-identification, the destructive power of love as well as the madness that can come of making a myth, but not at the expense of characters who are wholly alive and realized. He tempers the bleakness with a wickedly dry humor and an ever increasing pace that makes the book hard to put down<br />(buy both volumes, it really is just one story).<br /><br />The novel is printed and bound to look like a hotel bible in red faux leather with a sparse pattern of birds on volume I that becomes almost a blot on the cover of volume II. The biblical look is carried through to the inside with line number and large font numbers for each chapter heading and gilt page edges and ribbon markers.

964,1590210050,3,"Brit Mandelo's Beyond Binary is a collection of previously published Genderqueer and Sexually Fluid Speculative Fiction that I'd been looking forward to for quite some time. Having finally had a chance to read it through and go back to revisit a few of the stories I felt weren't quite so deserving of the tag speculative fiction, I have to say it's an interesting enough collection. There are some stellar entries that definitely make this worth a read, but overall I was disappointed in the extent to which the authors attempted to queer the concept of gender.<br /><br />Nalo Hopkinson's \\""Fisherman\\"" was definite highlight of the collection for me, with it's languid revelation of gender and its remarkably sincere exploration of sexuality. The relationship that develops here is a delight to experience, with an understanding whore who acknowledges and respects her client's chosen gender, while equally accommodating and his birth gender in their intimacies.<br /><br />Ellen Kushner's \\""A Wild and Wicked Youth\\"" was another strong addition to the book, a longer story about very personal expressions of gender and unusual expressions of sexuality. If you never thought fighting could be sexy, or that enjoying the thrill of victory could be orgasmic, then you need to read this. Very clever, and very well-done.<br /><br />Sonya Taaffe's \\""Another Coming\\"" was a beautifully written piece, full of haunting imagery, but it only strains the gender binary with one relationship, and it's never satisfactorily explained how it could work. A lovely bisexual story, but not necessarily genderqueer.<br /><br />Sarah Kanning's \\""Sex with Ghosts\\"" was another favourite of mine, featuring a robot sex worker with a flair for English poetry. Deeper and more intellectual than the idea of a robot sex worker might have you suspect, this definitely played into my love for authors like D.B. Story who explore gender and sexuality through those artificial constructs who exist outside the binary.<br /><br />Keyan Bowes' \\""Spoiling Veena\\"" lacked something in the storytelling that would have elevated it to favourite status, which is a shame because the subject matter was so compelling.

It bored me to death within the first couple chapters and went downhill from there. All John did was worry or be stupid and don't even get me started on Sam and Six, the whole love triangle thing was not good. The action sences were pitful and they barely fought... And John has no cool power he can just glow (wow)..........the only part I sorta liked was Maria, but even that was dragged on and on and on................the action at the end was goodish, but honestly John is my favorite character and he was really bad in it.

You can tell by the passion in the writing that the author of this book, Al Norman, has looked at Wal-Mart up close and in the heat of conflict. What he sees you won't like either. Norman's essays in this collection were all originally published on The Huffington Post. Because each piece is short, you can really read them in any order, and like layers of paint, they cover the \\""Wal\\"" from cover to cover. I especially like the detailed stories about how the giant corporation deals with the little people who get in its way, and the blog about how Alice Walton used her fabulous wealth to open up an art museum in the Ozarks (\\""Let them eat art.\\""). It's interesting how this company has attracted former Democratic political operatives to serve as its PR agents. The stories in this book are woven around the theme that Wal-Mart is a poster corporation for the Occupy Movement. As Norman writes in one chapter \\""If ever there was a teaching moment for economic injustice--Wal-Mart is it.\\"" Put down your shopping list and read this book.\\"""

She doesn't even know what commonly used abbreviations mean, and someone has to explain these things to her. She didn't think her actions through very well, either. She started off the story doing something that made me think, \\""Do you want the old lady to be killed?!\\"" yet she rationalized that her actions were going to help the woman. At least no one in the book acted like she was especially clever, and her partner in investigation was \\""street smart.\\"" I found them and the other characters interesting and engaging.<br /><br />The story had sections from the cat's point of view. I thought that the language--or something about how the cat expressed himself--was a little too human at first, but this got better throughout the story. He was given very cat motives for the things he did, and things were set up very naturally for the cat to act the way he did at the end. I liked the cat.<br /><br />The mystery wasn't very complex. It was more like in real life, where people have a good idea of whodunit--or at least who was behind it--but not exactly who all was involved. In this case, they also didn't know where the main suspect was, though I thought they were a little slow in considering the possibilities. The suspense was created by physical danger to Sunny and on wondering if the lottery ticket would be found. There was also some relationship tensions.<br /><br />There was no sex. There was a fair amount of explicit bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable novel.<br /><br />I received this book as a review copy from the publisher."

Each story has the text on the left side, with colorful full-page illustrations by Clare Caddy on the right page.<br /><br />My youngest two children really do love this Bible.  It is the perfect size for my 19 month old to carry around, and she often brings it to me to read to her.

I realize that it's an application Bible that tells of ways that God helped different people, but I still feel that it should have included the most important way that God has helped us, by Christ's atoning sacrifice!  It includes three stories about the events of His birth, but nothing about the very reason that He was born.<br /><br />Despite that, I still love this little book.

Second, to plan her own wedding to Aaron Zook -- a marriage she's been dreaming about ever since childhood. And yet, although she had missed the idyllic farms and families of her upbringing, Marianna is surprised that Indiana is somehow making her long now for Montana.<br /><br />As months pass, secrets that were hidden in winter's frozen grasp thaw and take on a life of their own. The truths about a child, about a past relationship, and about God's plans are being revealed. Walking through a valley of questions, Marianna must hold on to hope as she decides where and with whom her heart truly belongs.<br />This is an enjoyable story, with a strong sweet believable main character.  This Amish fiction is full of the struggle between embracing the freedom offered by faith in God's gift of salvation by Christ, and the works based traditions.  The author has written well of the hope which is restored when we stop trying to work our way and allow Christ's gift to wash over us.<br />I did find the story rather predictable, but it was sweet and wholesome.  Philippians 4 tells us whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.

979,098150177X,3,"Over the years Al-Anon has had many authors of many books.  Some consider Al-Anon to be much like Hazelden today, in that books are being provided by Al-Anon often, making Al-Anon look more like just one more publishing house.  While Al-Anon insists that only Conference Approved Literature be used at their meetings, finding people who actually voted to approve the most recent book seems easier said than done.<br /><br />In this most recent book \\""Many Voices, One Journey,\\"" one would sense that the book could have easily avoided some historical goofs if they ever had the book reviewed by an archivist in A.A, so that embarrassing historical errors would not be present. It was not the \\""Oxford Groups,\\"" it was the \\""Oxford Group.\\""  Seven A.A. meetings did not exist prior to the publication of A.A.'s basic text, only two existed: in New York and Akron.

What a shame.  Reading this book doesn't begin to give her the credit she deserves.<br /><br />Otherwise, I've enjoyed the archivist information and the work done to collect a wealth of information.  I've learned quite a number of things I hadn't previously known about the sources of Al-Anon material.  The revision history of some early Al-Anon literature can be a bewildering task to follow.  From an organizational standpoint,I appreciate the work of the author(s).  There can be so many Al-Anon literature and pamphlets displayed at a meeting!  By themselves, that can be very intimidating.<br /><br />However, in the end result, much of this book looks to be documenting mainly what man has done.  If God had much of anything to do with the creation of Al-Anon, I guess that's an opinion which one should seek elsewhere."
980,0618574948,4,"Writing Quality: 6/10.<br />Tolkien is a capable writer, but not a great one. He periodically injects humor into the tale, but it is sometimes inconsistent, and rarely truly witty, as opposed to what someone like T. H. White does in The Once and Future King. There is an intriguing, archaic storytelling quality to his stories, a product of his respected academic work with such early works as Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. It's consistent, and immersing. But the real draw of Tolkien's work, in my opinion, has less to do with his prose, and more to do with his storytelling, which is something more difficult to define, but has more to do with ideas and less with artistic craft. His descriptions sometimes feel like they bog the story down, and even his most-quoted and well-loved lines -- \\""Not all who wander are lost\\"" and \\""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us\\"" -- are not the creations of a wordsmith, but simple philosophical aphorisms that have been made memorable by a memorable story.<br /><br />Depth of Concept: 8/10.<br />Tolkien himself chafed at the idea that his tales would be picked apart in classrooms, and he very much resisted the idea that they were allegorical. It's just a story, he would say, just enjoy it in whatever way works for you. But Tolkien, as an academic, was also steeped in allegory and myth creation, in studies of hero journeys and tragic flaws. What Tolkien really means is that The Lord of the Rings is not merely allegory, not merely something to dissect and explain. Instead, he also hopes for it to touch something more primitive and inexpressible in the psyche, something that can elicit visceral and emotional responses without having to be deconstructed. It certainly has proven to do that, but as such a rich work of mythopoeia, the multiple interpretive meanings available in the story are also very rich.<br /><br />Rounded Characters: 6/10.<br />This is a tough one to score. On one hand, many of the characters are very flat, undergo very little change, or have very little ambiguity in their personalities. Aragorn, for example, is a pretty one-dimensional hero figure, albeit a cool one. But the depth of his character is perhaps a \\""3.\\"" The development of loyalty and friendship in Sam is perhaps a little more rounded. But the reason I scored Tolkien as high as a 6 here, was because of Gollum's developmental process through the novels, which I think was highlighted well in the Peter Jackson movies. If there is an interesting story of redemption in all of Tolkien's work, Gollum is it. For him, I'd rate something around an 8 or 9, balancing out many of the other less-developed characters.<br /><br />Well-Developed World: 10/10.<br />Of course, this is where Tolkien has to score the highest. His world-building isn't as existential or all-encompassing as what you can find in Moby Dick or Midnight's Children, but the great care and thoughtful planning of a whole, mostly original mythology is astonishing. It's too bad that so many fantasy writers connected so strongly with Tolkien's truly great accomplishment, and then tried to mimic him in inferior ways. The difference between what Tolkien did and what his imitators (Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, etc.) do is that he truly understood what makes a meaningful, ambiguous, expansive world, one that is more than the sum of its parts and that draws meaningful parallels with other mythologies from around the world. Reading Tolkien's works feels like the real deal, a real body of myth and legend handed down from generation to generation. Tolkien's imitators always seem to focus most on cool characters, exotic lands, and fun magic systems, and present a painfully muddled, and even careless understanding of what makes myth and legend stay pertinent over eons. Tolkien drew from his vast knowledge of Germanic mythology and philology in writing his novels; people like Brooks and Jordan appear to have used only Tolkien's novels as their foundation.<br /><br />Page Turner: 7/10.<br />I debated how to score this category, because I've come to realize that as a kid I must have skimmed and skipped much of The Lord of the Rings in order to get to the \\""good stuff,\\"" the battles and adventurous portions. When I go back and read now, it's not so much that the prose feels dense, as that much of it seems unnecessary. It's not hard reading . . . it's just that it often seems to take so long for a character to get from one place to another, without what appears to be sufficient justification. I wouldn't want to merely have the \\""good stuff\\"" and none of the rest of Tolkien's rambling explorations, because then I might as well just be reading Brooks' The Sword of Shannara or something. But I wonder what a really aggressive but erudite editor might have done to streamline Tolkien's prose and tighten up his story. Ultimately, the book doesn't feel particularly well-paced, but Tolkien accomplishes such a rich and appealing atmosphere that it can be hard to put it down, even when you wish things would move a little quicker.<br /><br />Kept Me Thinking: 7/10.<br />This wasn't like Moby Dick for me, where there were so many fantastic philosophical concepts running about in my head that I almost felt like I was achieving Burke's sublime. Rather, Tolkien created such a powerful other world that I can't help daydreaming about his world even after putting the book down. It's justifiable to question whether the thinking about Tolkien's Middle-earth is of as high quality as the thinking engendered in me after reading Moby Dick, but there is no doubt that The Fellowship of the Ring stayed in my head long after I turned the final page. And perhaps where that rumination can be particularly useful is asking why it stuck in my head, and dissecting the common human connection with myth. Enter Joseph Campbell and The Hero with a Thousand Faces.<br /><br />__________________________________________________<br /><br />Overall Recommendation: 9/10.<br />You could get by without reading The Lord of the Rings, although it seems silly to willfully ignore something that is so present in the modern psyche, and that is the best example of its kind by which you can judge the mediocrity all around us today, both in literature and in film.

Once you realize this, you are less controlled by stimuli or sensations\\"". \\""You cultivate a responsive rather than reactive relationship with your thoughts, feelings, and sensations. You can thoughtfully choose what to do, say, or think next. You notice what feels right because you're paying attention, and this makes it easier to take action and make more nourishing choices\\"".<br /><br />Beyond of all the goodies that such practices will bring to you + your life, you will become a more compassionate human being towards self and others. You will have the opportunity to bring (bridge) Heaven into Earth, which will transform yourself and your environment.<br /><br />Sarah McLean's book has a lot to offer you if you embrace the journey.<br />Blessings to you, and thanks for reading my review."

The commentary helps me dig into the Word more and gets me to think about what the scripture is saying a little more in depth.<br />I love the leather binding and Celtic cross at the front with the silver lined pages.  The Bible itself looks beautiful and is the perfect size for me (it is a study Bible, so it's still pretty big, but it's nice to have it in personal size as I have never had one before).<br />Definitely recommend it to anyone, I LOVE IT! You'll love it too. :)"

But I probably wouldn't have bothered to purchase this book if it weren't for all the one-star reviews from the wingnuts from the Right. Since it's got them in tizzy, it *must* be good!"
994,1461061288,5,"Dr. Richard Rose has a flair for creative writing witnessed in the seven stories and a section on poetry in two volumes.  The stories take place in the past, present, and future.  The stories may be read separately, although a thread runs through with characters reappearing.<br />Dr. Rose uses his knowledge in science, military, music, education, literature, and gardening to embellish the story telling.<br />Volume two is a challenge, although a welcome one.  The future is imagined with parts of the east coast underwater.  Dr. Rose's homespun philosophy of humanitarianism, in both volumes, is evident during the dialogue of main characters.  This adds a welcome dimension to an often omitted theme in today's novels."

998,0307890457,3,"I usually enjoy Prima's game guides and was hopeful for this one. Unfortunately it falls way short. The maps and nice and fairly detailed, with every world. Unfortunately they don't go into much detail other than that. More details such as vendor's names, or locations of quest givers or even mapping out where Republic and Imperial questing areas are so you can see where potential PVP areas could be. Things like Balmorra being phased between the 2 factions would be nice to know too.<br /><br />I was expecting more of a guide as well, not just an atlas. They do give some details about the classes but nothing truly insightful. You could get as much from the Holonet.<br /><br />Overall it's a great book for collector's but if you're thinking about buying it to help you with the game...skip it."
